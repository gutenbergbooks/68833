LILY AND ROSEBUD.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>THE THREE PRINCESSES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF anybody had happened to be walking along
what was called the Robbers’ Road, in Long
Forest, a part of the possessions of good King
Brondé, who lived many, many hundred years ago,
he would have perceived that the road was continually
curving towards the right. He would also
soon have grown weary, for this winding road led,
by degrees, to the top of a mountain. But if he
had kept on and on, and did not give up for weariness,
he would at length have come to the palace of
the very king himself. A magnificent palace it was,
too, and a sight of it well worth the long journey.</p>

<p>If you could but have seen how the gilded roof
shone in the sunlight! and the white marble statues
in the gardens! and the fountains and the
round ponds filled with gold and silver fishes! and
the flocks of lambs with blue and pink ribbons
around their necks! and the shepherdesses all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
dressed in white, each with her crook and her
wreath of flowers!—if you could but have seen all
these beautiful things, then would the weary journey
have been soon forgotten.</p>

<p>And could you have entered the palace itself,
and have kept your eyes from being blinded by the
bright colors, the sparkling ornaments, and all the
splendor of this wonderful place, and have wandered
on and on, through the spacious apartments,
you would at last have come to an ivory door, over
which was perched a red-and-green parrot. This
parrot was fed upon flowers made from crystals of
white sugar; and had you given him one of these
he would have told you a riddle. But this, of
course, you could not know. And indeed, when
the door was once open, you would have forgotten
parrots and everything else in gazing at the beautiful
lady within,—the beautiful pale lady, King
Brondé’s queen.</p>

<p>This is her private chamber. The windows are
lofty, and more than half hidden by rich curtains
of crimson. The walls are covered with cloth of
crimson and gold. Vases of white lilies fill the
air with their fragrance. How beautiful is the pale
lady, reclining upon her dark cushions of velvet!
Her robe is of blue silk, embroidered with silver.
Her fair hair is adorned with a wreath of blue
flowers. These flowers are made of precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
stones, and the leaves are of silver. Her eyes are
blue, too, very blue,—bluer than her silk robe,—bluer
than the flowers in her hair. And oh! if
her cheeks had but looked rosy then, she would
have been the most beautiful queen in the world.
But her face was very, very pale; so that when
she was not called the Queen, she was often called
the Pale Lady, or the White Lady, and sometimes
the Lily Queen.</p>

<p>But what are those blue eyes looking upon so
earnestly, so tenderly, so sadly?</p>

<p>Ah! that I can soon tell you.</p>

<p>But first I must tell you that fastened to the ceiling
was a golden eagle, holding in its claws a long
silver cord. This cord sustained a sort of canopy,
made of white velvet, and fringed with silver.
From this canopy hung curtains of the most gauzy,
delicate lace. These were now looped up with
their jewelled bands, and it was something underneath
upon which the blue eyes of the Pale Lady
were fixed so earnestly.</p>

<p>Now this something underneath was something
very charming indeed.</p>

<p>It was a babe which lay there, sleeping in its
cradle.</p>

<p>This cradle was curiously wrought of sandalwood
and rosewood and boxwood and ivory. It
was lined with down, and its cushions were white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and soft as new-fallen snow. The quilt was embroidered
with pearls. At each of its four corners,
and bending over it, was the sculptured figure of a
little smiling boy. Those at the foot seemed playing
softly on musical instruments, as if soothing the
child to slumber. The two at the head were represented
as holding out poppies over the infant
beneath.</p>

<p>But why should the mother look with sadness
upon her babe? If any one could weep in such a
beautiful place, we might fancy almost those were
tears in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>The Pale Lady had, no doubt, cause for sorrow;
for she sighed frequently, and bowed her head upon
the velvet cushions, saying, “O my precious one!
what shall I ask for thee?”</p>

<p>At length she took from her bosom a curiously
shaped whistle, which, when she put it to her lips,
gave forth the sweetest notes you ever heard.</p>

<p>Then the ivory door opened softly, and there
came in a bright black-eyed little boy, in a red turban.
The lady, without speaking, pointed to a casket
at the opposite side of the room. This the
little black-eyed, also without speaking, placed in
her hands, and then, with the very lightest of footsteps
and the very lowest of bows, he left the
room.</p>

<p>The lady unlocked the casket, and, after opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
many little drawers, she at last took out a most
fairy-like cup, made of alabaster, perfectly plain
and white. Then, lifting the crimson and gold
hangings from the wall near by, she pressed her
finger upon what seemed to be a small picture
fastened in the wood-work. A drawer flew out,
from which the Pale Lady took three small green
stones and a vial. Placing the stones in the cup,
she poured over them a liquid from the vial, and
very soon there began to arise a vapor, which spread
through the apartment. And the Pale Lady, while
the vapor was rising, sang, in low tones, these
words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wild Mountain Fairy, in robes of green,</div>
<div class="verse">List to the call of the Lily Queen.</div>
<div class="verse">O, speed thee! speed quickly o’er land and o’er sea,</div>
<div class="verse">For the child and its mother are waiting for thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As the vapor melted away, there was seen,
standing by the cradle, a beautiful white lamb;
which, after walking three times around the room,
became transformed into as pretty a green fairy as
ever was seen. Now this is what the fairy said
to the lady, and what the lady said to the fairy.</p>

<p><i>Fairy.</i>—“Yes: three times I promised to come
at thy bidding. This is the third. What now is
the wish of the fair Lily Queen?”</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i>—“Fairy, I pray thee bestow something
good—something blessed—upon my youngest-born.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span><i>Fairy.</i>—“Yes, lady. And what shall it be? It
is thine to choose. How is it with the two princesses,
her sisters? Did I not well by them?”</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i>—“Fairy, what I asked thou gavest.
For the eldest, I chose the gift of perfect beauty,
for I said, ‘Every one loves the beautiful; she will
draw all hearts to herself.’”</p>

<p><i>Fairy.</i>—“And thus did it prove?”</p>

<p><i>Lady.</i>—“Listen! I hear her step. Judge
now for thyself.”</p>

<p>As the ivory door swung open, the beautiful princess
entered. Perfect beauty had indeed been
given her. There was in her countenance such a
bloom, such a freshness, such a smile upon her lip,
such a light in her eye, that, having once looked,
one was hardly able to turn away. She wore no
ornament, well knowing that gold could buy nothing
so pretty, so bright, so radiant, as herself.</p>

<p>“And such beauty as this, or even greater,
wouldst thou choose for thy youngest-born?”
asked the fairy.</p>

<p>“O no, no, no!” said the lady, earnestly.
“O fairy! yonder beauty has no heart, and none
love her. She is not happy; she makes no one
happy.”</p>

<p>“And did I not warn thee?” asked the fairy.</p>

<p>“Fairy, thou didst. The blame is mine,—mine
only. I foolishly trusted that beauty alone would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
draw loving hearts around her. Oh! she is vain;
she is silly; she is proud. Examine the book she
holds. Inside its covers are little mirrors, that she
may continually enjoy the sight of her beauty. All
the artists in the kingdom are busy painting likenesses
of her face, her form, her hands. And you
will perceive that the very figures upon her dress
are only so many miniatures of herself.”</p>

<p>“And her sister, the second princess,” inquired
the fairy, “upon whom, at your request, I conferred
great wisdom,—you surely find comfort in her?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” replied the lady, “although she can
converse in all languages, and not even the wisest
philosopher can puzzle her with questions, yet she
cannot make herself beloved, for she knows not the
secret of making even the poorest child happy.
Though despising beauty, yet she is envious of her
sister; and their want of affection saddens my whole
life. But you will see, now, this wise princess.
That is her step approaching. It will be very fortunate
if we understand her, for seldom does she
converse in our own language.”</p>

<p>Again the ivory door opened, to admit the second
princess, who instantly began talking.</p>

<p>“Alski, mofo, se lup tak sba tab enryo dyo!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Her dress was a brownish robe, reaching to the
floor. It was covered with ink-spots. Her hair was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
tumbled, and stuck full of pens. Her hands were
filled with big charts and rolls of manuscripts.</p>

<p>“Potobi, ritu fo bam. Shik, sho, tabi,” said she,
approaching her beautiful sister so awkwardly that
she almost trod upon one of the pretty miniatures
in her dress. The beauty sprang angrily up, and
there would have been a great quarrel, had not the
Green Fairy, with a motion of her wand, ordered
them from the apartment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pale Lily Queen, paler now than
ever, sat sighing and weeping.</p>

<p>“Arouse yourself, dear lady,” said the fairy,
“and choose quickly, for others may summon me,
and I must soon be gone.”</p>

<p>“Good fairy,” said the lady, “bestow upon her,
not happiness for herself, but the blessing of bringing
happiness to others. I ask for her the gift of
exceeding love. Kindle a love-flame in her heart
which shall never grow dim.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the fairy, “what you ask is not
mine to give. Far, far away, in a land which no
mortal and no fairy ever saw, is an altar upon which
the holy fire is constantly burning. Now, although
no mortal and no fairy may enter there, yet there
may, and there do, come messengers from thence,
bearing sparks of this holy fire. Happy the heart
which receives such messengers, for the love-flame,
once kindled from the sacred fire, is never quenched.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
And all who have love in their hearts possess the
blessing you have chosen,—the power and the will
to create happiness. Be silent, now, and let only
beautiful and holy thoughts enter your mind.”</p>

<p>The fairy then described with her wand a circle
upon the floor, in the centre of which she stood for
some time, motionless. At last, in a low voice, she
began chanting,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Beautiful Spirit! Spirit of Love,</div>
<div class="verse">Why dost thou tarry? O, where dost thou rove?</div>
<div class="verse">Linger not by the altar, sweet Spirit, for see!</div>
<div class="verse">The child of the Lily Queen waiteth for thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>As she chanted, her voice grew fainter and fainter.
Her form faded, becoming more and more shadow-like,
until, at length, its last dim outline disappeared.</p>

<p>But while the Pale Lady was still gazing at the
spot where the fairy had stood, she heard a voice
faintly singing,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“The Fairy Green</div>
<div class="verse">No more is seen.</div>
<div class="verse">Look not for me,</div>
<div class="verse">Dear lady. But see!</div>
<div class="verse">Where cometh above</div>
<div class="verse">The Spirit of Love.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The lady raised her eyes to the ceiling, and saw
there what appeared to be a kind of white cloud.
While gazing, full of wonder at this strange appearance,
she perceived, flying from it, a small, white
dove. Following its motions with her eye, she saw
that it was flying in circles around the cradle.
These circles grew smaller and smaller, and at
length the beautiful little creature alighted upon the
clasped hands of the child, and then creeping into
its bosom, just where its little heart was beating, it
lay there as quietly as if it had never in its life
known any other nest.</p>

<p>The lady now perceived that the air was filled
with the singing of birds, and, looking up, she saw
that the white cloud had changed, and was now of
the most brilliant colors; and that from the midst<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of it were flying birds such as she had never before
seen or heard,—birds of the most radiant plumage,
purple and gold and scarlet, and whose warbling
was inexpressibly melodious. The whole room was
filled with their brightness and with their music.
They seemed to be attendants of the white dove,
for they hovered about the cradle, though not one
alighted. Poised in the air, fluttering their bright
wings, their singing was not like that of birds, but
like some heavenly anthem, such as she had imagined
might be sung by angels.</p>

<p>At first this music was overpowering, but grew
softer by degrees, and so soothing that the lady soon
lost all consciousness of what was about her. Her
eyelids drooped, and she wondered how it was that
the music sounded so far away.</p>

<p>When the power of opening her eyes was restored
to her, she looked eagerly about, and then
grew very sad, for there were no sweet sounds in
the room,—no birds, no music.</p>

<p>Running to her child, she searched eagerly in its
bosom. But no dove was there,—nothing but a
warm, bright red spot, just over its little heart.</p>

<p>The babe opened its blue eyes, smiled, and put
out its tiny hands to its mother; and the Pale Lady
might have thought she had been dreaming, were
it not for the bright red spot which, as I said before,
was plainly to be seen just over the little quick-beating
heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>KING BRONDÉ.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH I have told you something of his
palace and of his daughters and of his queen,
I have as yet hardly spoken of the king himself.</p>

<p>King Brondé was once a poor little boy, and
lived with his mother in a brown hut or cottage,
near the borders of a forest. One day, when he
was in the forest with some other children, chopping
fagots for his mother’s fire, a giant chanced to
pass that way, and, by accident, his foot became entangled
in the branches of a thick thorn-tree, causing
him to roar out most lustily. The other children
screamed, and ran away. But Brondé climbed
the tree, and, with his hatchet, hacked away the
branches.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my little man!” said the giant.
“Come, live with me, and I’ll teach you to grow.
Would you like that?”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” said the lad, “if mother
will say yes.”</p>

<p>He then ran quickly home, and cried out,—</p>

<p>“Mother! mother! May I grow up a big
man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“To be sure!” said his mother. “What’s to
hinder?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lad, “I shall go now to live
with the giant, and he will teach me.”</p>

<p>Then his mother began to weep and to wail most
bitterly, and to say, “O no! O no!”</p>

<p>But when the little boy said he was not afraid,
and told how stout he would grow and how he
would take care of her, and how proud she should
be of such a big son, she wiped her tears and gave
him her consent. So Brondé ran to the forest, and
cried out, “Sir giant! sir giant! I am ready.”
And then the giant put him in his pocket, and
walked away.</p>

<p>And Brondé lived a year in the cave; and the
giant fed him with something which caused him to
grow very big and very tall and very strong. This
something was a mountain herb which giants fed
upon, and may, no doubt, be still found in that
region, only that no one knows the spot where it
grows.</p>

<p>Brondé, as I said, grew very large and strong,
and would, no doubt, have some day become a
giant himself, had his stout friend lived long
enough.</p>

<p>But the giant grew sick, and laid him down to
die. Knowing that his end was near, he called
Brondé close to his mouth, and said to him:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“I shall soon leave you now. Have I not been
a friend to you? Have I not fulfilled my promise?”</p>

<p>Then, as Brondé could not answer for crying, the
giant went on:—</p>

<p>“There is but one man living as large and strong
as yourself. He calls himself Magnus, or ‘The
Great.’ Years ago, I did for him what I have done
for you. But he grew wicked as fast as he grew
strong, and I drove him from me. You will readily
know him; for he is exactly your size. His hair,
however, is not fair and curly like yours, but black
and coarse. I pray, however, that you may never
meet, for he would gladly kill you, that there may
be no man living as large and as strong himself.</p>

<p>“Death is near,” continued the giant, “and I am
not sorry; for mine has been but a lonely life. But
before we part I would bestow upon you a parting gift.
It is one which this Magnus, of whom I have spoken,
often begged of me, but never obtained. You see
this vial. A few drops of its contents confer upon
the person swallowing them immense strength. As
its effects pass off, he sinks into a stupor resembling
death, from which he awakes with only his usual
powers. You are young, active, and will seek adventure,—brave,
and will fear no danger. You
will encounter perils; you will be reduced to extremities
in which even your uncommon strength
shall not avail. Preserve, therefore, this little vial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
with the utmost care, and never use it unless your
very life depends upon its aid.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i023.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“This, then,” said the giant, as he hung the
vial about the neck of Brondé by a stout cord,
“this is my dying gift; listen, now, to my dying
request.</p>

<p>“When I am dead, leave my body in this cave.
Roll rocks about the mouth of it, till no opening
can be seen. Pull up oak-trees and plant them
around, that no one may ever discover the entrance
to my tomb.”</p>

<p>So the giant died; and Brondé, with his immense
strength, rolled rocks and planted trees, until the
cave was entirely concealed. And, to this day, no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
traveller journeying that way ever knew he was
passing the tomb of a giant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now Brondé had lived in the cave just a year
and a day. And the same flowers were in bloom,
the meadows were as green, the waters as blue, the
sky was as bright, the air as soft, and the birds were
singing as sweetly the very same tunes, as on the
day when he kissed his mother and ran to meet the
giant in the forest.</p>

<p>And Brondé wondered, as he travelled homeward,
whether he really were Brondé, and really
had a mother living in a brown cottage by the edge
of a forest. And the more he wondered, the faster
he walked; until, at length, he walked so fast that
no horse could pass him by.</p>

<p>Now, when his mother, who was looking out
from her little window at the house-top, saw this
big fellow coming at such a rate, she ran down to
fasten the door. She was too late, however, for he
was already in the room, and searching for something
on the top shelf of the cupboard.</p>

<p>“Ah, here it is!” said he,—“the little blue
honey-pot. Now it is certain I am Brondé. For
though there might be a brown cottage like this, it
would not have a cupboard like this, and a little blue
honey-pot on the top shelf.”</p>

<p>When the good dame reached the bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
stairs, she was terribly frightened to see such a
powerful man in possession of her room and her
honey-pot.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” said he, “but I have travelled
long, and am very hungry.”</p>

<p>The dame, seeing she could do no other, brought
her oatmeal cakes and all her pans of milk, and
then, by way of passing the time, asked if there
were any news.</p>

<p>“O, great news!” said he; “the giant is dead.”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the good woman, beginning to
weep, “where, then, is my little son?”</p>

<p>Then Brondé laughed, and cried out,—</p>

<p>“I am your little son!”</p>

<p>And he pulled from his pocket the whole suit of
clothes which he had worn away.</p>

<p>Then the dame knew it was her own son, and
would have fainted away for joy, had not Brondé
caught her in his arms and kissed her and hugged
her as if she had only been a little child.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And Brondé lived many years with his mother,
and was a good son to her till she died.</p>

<p>He then went forth into the world to seek his
fortune. And chancing to stop in a great city,
through which a legion of soldiers was passing, he
resolved to join the army, and fight for the king.</p>

<p>Now the king of the land soon heard of the marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
deeds of his new soldier, and straightway
sent for him to come to the palace, that he might
behold with his own eyes this great wonder.</p>

<p>Brondé, therefore, visited the palace. And the
king was so charmed with his lofty stature, his
noble air, and his fine appearance, that he must
needs have him among his own private guards, and
very soon made him captain over them all. And it
was soon found that this great soldier was as good
as he was great, and as gentle as he was strong.
For never in his life had he used his strength to
oppress the weak; but, on the contrary, sought to
help all who were in distress.</p>

<p>Now the king had an only child, a daughter as
fair and sweet as a lily. And the king never called
her anything but his White Lily, or his Precious
Lily. This princess was the life and light of the
court. She was sweet-tempered and modest, yet
merry and playful as a kitten, dancing and singing
from morning to night.</p>

<p>And one day, when the king was away, and the
courtiers were feasting in the grand banquet-hall,
there ran in among them maidens weeping, and crying
out,—</p>

<p>“Save the princess! Oh! who will save the
princess?”</p>

<p>And every one rushed from the palace to learn
what had befallen the king’s Lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>The maidens ran swiftly towards the river, and
then every one thought she had been drowned.
But no. On towards the mountains the maidens
ran. And, half-way up the mountain path, they
pointed below to a crevice between two huge rocks,
and told how the princess, in her eagerness to chase
a gazelle, had slipped and fallen through. And
hardly had they finished speaking before the voice
of the princess was heard, in tones of distress, calling
out for help.</p>

<p>All were now in dismay, crying out, “Alas!
alas! the princess will die!”</p>

<p>But when Brondé arrived, and saw that trees
were growing about the foot of the outer rock, he
quickly let himself down, and began pulling them
out by their roots. This so loosened the earth that,
by means of his great strength, he could easily start
the rock from its nest. And this he did, and sent
it rolling, whirling, plunging, nobody looked to see
how far, for all were busy with the princess, who,
though very little hurt, was trembling with fright.
And Brondé, seeing that she could hardly stand,
took her in his arms and bore her to the palace, the
rest following far behind.</p>

<p>If he had not taken her in his arms and borne
her to the palace, it is probable this story would
never have been written, as will presently be
shown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<p>When the
princess found
herself unhurt,
she began to
laugh within
herself at this
adventure, and
at the odd way
she was travelling
home. And as her
head lay upon the shoulder—the
big, broad shoulder—of
Brondé, his long,
fair curls touched her
cheek. So, being fond of
mischief, she slyly drew
forth her scissors, cut off
one curl, and kept it hid
in her hand. And Brondé
did not know a word
about it; though, had he known, it would not have
displeased him, since, had she wished, he would
gladly have given her every one of them; for he
was quite fond of the charming little princess.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i028.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And he grew still more fond of her as years
passed, and wondered within himself whether such
a big fellow as he could ever please such a delicate
little creature as the king’s Lily. And if that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
could ever happen, why, what would the king say
then? It was quite doubtful whether he should be
thought worthy to be the son-in-law of a king.
Whatever his thoughts were, therefore, none were
the wiser for them, as they remained hidden in his
own breast.</p>

<p>Now the king’s Lily looked with admiration upon
the brave, noble-hearted Brondé.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said she to herself, “he is gentle and
good, and can do no wrong; he is strong and brave,
and can fear no danger; and he is handsome enough
to gaze upon for a lifetime. And I think,—I
think he likes very well even a small, pale thing
like me; yet he has never told me this.”</p>

<p>So she, too, kept her own counsel, and nobody
was the wiser. But it is curious to see how, sometimes,
events are brought about.</p>

<p>The king said one day to his daughter: “Choose
you now a husband, for old age is coming upon me,
and I would know, before I die, that my child and
my kingdom are well cared for.”</p>

<p>But the pretty White Lily grew bashful and said,
“Let me not choose, but rather be chosen.”</p>

<p>Then the king said: “Who would dare to choose
my beautiful Lily, my princess? But give yourself
no uneasiness, since I myself can make the
choice.”</p>

<p>Then the princess was quite troubled, not knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
upon whom the choice might fall. And she
thought that by a cunning little trick matters might
be well arranged. So she said to her father, the
king: “My dearest father, in coming from the
mountains one day, I discovered a lock of hair, so
beautiful that I have preserved it ever since. Whoever,
now, in all your court, can match this lock
with one of his own, he, and he only, shall be my
choice.”</p>

<p>Now when this declaration of the princess was
made known, it caused great commotion among the
young nobles of the court. All were examining
their locks, and longing to know the color of that
which the king’s Lily had discovered in coming from
the mountain.</p>

<p>Brondé sent in one of his fair curls with the rest,
and was, of course, the lucky winner. For not one
in the whole court had hair so soft and of so beautiful
a color as he.</p>

<p>And he soon found that the heart of the princess
was quite large enough to love even so big a fellow
as himself. And the princess made the discovery
that the small, pale thing, as she had called herself,
was the very thing, in all the world, that Brondé
most wished for. The king, too, was well pleased
to give to his daughter so kind a protector, and to
his kingdom so brave a defender. And thus it happened,
for once, that everybody was pleased. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
lady with her lover, the lover with his lady, the
king with his son-in-law, and the people with their
king that was to be.</p>

<p>There was one person, however, who, far away,
hearing of Brondé’s good fortune, was not so well
pleased. This person was a man of great strength
and size, who has already been spoken of. He called
himself Magnus, or “The Great.”</p>

<p>He, too, had once been among the king’s guards,
and would have been quite ready to take both daughter
and kingdom. But by reason of his cruelty and
for his many bad acts, he was banished from the country.
After Brondé had been made a great captain
in the army, Magnus went to him secretly, by night,
and said: “Come, now, we two are strong and can
accomplish whatsoever we will. Let us gather
about us a troop of brave men; let us entice the
king’s soldiers; there are many who will gladly
fight under two such powerful leaders. We will
attack the palace, throw the king into prison, and
become ourselves rulers of the land.”</p>

<p>But Brondé said, “I will not use my strength to
do evil.” And Magnus, for this, hated Brondé, and
was, therefore, far from rejoicing at his good fortune.</p>

<p>His envy and his displeasure, however, were
alike unknown to Brondé and the princess. They
were married and lived happily. Their father, the
king, built for them two fine palaces, one within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
city and the other far away among the forests and
mountains. It was this summer palace, standing
high, all glittering with silver and gold, which was
spoken of in the beginning. And it will now be
understood that the Pale Lady, sitting in the Crimson
Chamber, was the good old king’s Lily Princess
whom Brondé saved on the mountain, whom he
bore home in his arms, and whom he afterwards
married. The old king had now long been dead,
and King Brondé was enjoying a peaceful reign.
Affairs went smoothly on, his people loved him and
he loved his people, and he still spent the summers
at the beautiful palace in Long Forest.</p>

<p>But peaceful days last not always, and troubles,
dangers, and bitter sorrows were in store for the
good King Brondé and his Lily Queen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>THE WOOD-CUTTER’S CHILDREN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WE left, at the end of the first chapter, a
child sleeping in its cradle within a chamber
of the royal palace. To this child, this third little
princess, was given the name of Rosebud. Her
father, King Brondé, it was, who gave his little
daughter this name. He came into the chamber
one day just as she had awakened, with flushed
cheeks, from a long sleep. Now the Lily Queen,
in remembrance of the Green Fairy, had the child
dressed always in green. King Brondé, when he
lifted her in his arms, said: “Why, my dear Lily,
with her red cheeks she is like a rosebud in its green
jacket.” And they agreed that she should be called
Rosebud.</p>

<p>And a sweet Rosebud she was to them always.
First, till she was a year old, when she walked;
then, till she was two years old, when she talked;
then, till three years old, when she sang; then, till
four years old, when she could sit before her father,
on horseback, and go forth riding in the forest. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
lords and ladies of the court were quite charmed
with the king’s Rosebud, and as her years increased
she came to be the delight of the whole palace.</p>

<p>For the love-flame kindled in her heart was always
burning there. It shone through her eyes, it lighted
up her face, and she had smiles and pleasant words
and loving ways for everybody.</p>

<p>The heart of the Pale Lily Queen was comforted.
And as for King Brondé, there was nothing too
beautiful or too costly for his darling Rosebud. She
was the joy of his heart.</p>

<p>But very often his Lily Queen would say to him:
“My dear Brondé, we are now too happy. Surely
some evil will soon befall us.”</p>

<p>Then would Brondé encircle the child with his
arms, and say, “O, may this precious one, at least,
be kept from harm.”</p>

<p>But the Lily Queen, sighing, would murmur softly
to herself, “Ah, she is too bright, too lovely a flower
for earth!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As Rosebud grew older, she showed great delight
in birds, squirrels, wild flowers, and everything
which lived or grew in the woods, and her attendants
had plenty to do in following her up and down
about the country. The woodmen all knew her,
for she was continually dancing along the forest
paths, or dropping like a sunbeam into their rude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
huts. Yes, like a sunbeam, for she brought the
light of her bright face and the warmth of her loving
heart. She made little children glad, she made
the old people glad, and for miles around every one
knew and loved the king’s Rosebud.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One day as Rosebud was walking with her sisters
along the river’s bank, they heard a noise as of some
one calling, “Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!”</p>

<p>It was not a shout, but a faint, mournful cry.
Looking up, they saw, at a short distance from the
shore, a small boat drifting along with the stream.
A pale, ragged child sat leaning his forehead upon
the boat’s edge, now and then raising it to call out,
in a feeble voice, “Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!
Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!”</p>

<p>Seeing the three maidens, he eagerly stretched
forth his hands as if asking for assistance.</p>

<p>The eldest princess said: “Pshaw! what do we
care for the ugly, dirty fellow?”</p>

<p>And the second princess said: “Stupid, ignorant
little wretch! Let him go!”</p>

<p>But the third princess ran for a man and a boat,
which were soon in readiness; for every one was
eager to obey even the slightest wish of little Rosebud.</p>

<p>When the drifting boat was towed to the shore,
there was found in it not only a boy, but a little girl,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
lying in the bottom of the boat,—a very pale little
girl, who seemed too weak to do more than just open
her brown eyes and gaze piteously about her. But
when food and cordials had been given them, it was
found that they could both talk, and that quite well.</p>

<p>Now this is the story the little boy told of himself
and his little sister.</p>

<p>They belonged a great way up the river. A long
time ago, he could not tell how long, there was famine
in that country, and their mother sickened and
died.</p>

<p>One day their father embraced them, with tears
in his eyes, and said:—</p>

<p>“Farewell, farewell, my pretty dears. I am
going now to seek employment in the kingdom of
good King Brondé, where, as I am told, all may
find work and bread.”</p>

<p>And they were left in the care of a woman who
treated them ill. This woman was not only cruel,
but a thief. She kept the gold their father sent, and
would give them no news of him, except that he
was a wood-cutter, in Long Forest.</p>

<p>One moonlight night the boy showed to his sister
a bag of dry crusts, and said, “Let us go and seek
our father.”</p>

<p>And she said, “O yes!”</p>

<p>Then they jumped into a little skiff, which had no
oar. “No matter for that,” said the boy; “it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
be sure to drift down.” For they knew that their
father had sailed away down the river.</p>

<p>And a very long river the boy thought it must
be. For they had drifted, night and day, through
many a desolate plain and gloomy forest. And all
the time he had kept shouting, loud and clear at
first, but more feebly as his strength grew less,
“Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La! Tirra, Tirra,
Tirra, Tirra La!”</p>

<p>“And what was that for?” asked Rosebud.</p>

<p>Why, in their own country, the boy said, were
robbers and bandits and many fierce men. There
was danger always; and their father, as he returned
from his day’s hunting, or his day’s labor, would
call out, while crossing the little bridge near their
cottage, “Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La! Tirra,
Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!” to let them know of his
safety. And they would answer back the same cry,
that he might be sure no harm had come to them in
his absence.</p>

<p>“And so,” continued the little boy, “we called,
‘Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!’ while floating
along, that our father might hear.”</p>

<p>“But he did not hear!” said the little girl, sadly.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” said Rosebud, “do not be sorrowful
any more, for this is Long Forest. The palace
of King Brondé is near, and I am his little girl,
and I shall help you to find your father. Pray what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
is his name?” But the children knew only that
he was called “Father.” “For all that, we shall
find him,” said Rosebud. And every morning,
though dressed out in costly array, and her princess’s
crown, she took the two children by the hand, and
they walked together along the forest paths; and
whenever they heard the sound of a wood-chopper’s
axe they shouted:—</p>

<p>“Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!” and then
stopped awhile to listen, but heard only the echoes,
repeating, more and more faintly, “Tirra, Tirra,
Tirra, Tirra La! Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!”</p>

<p>And the children grew very sad, and said, “O,
we shall never, never again see our father!”</p>

<p>And the two elder princesses said: “Rosebud,
why will you keep such low company? You really
trouble yourself a great deal about nothing.”</p>

<p>But Rosebud answered, “Is it nothing to lose a
father?” And she cheered the two children, and
said to them: “Do not give up yet, for I am sure
we shall not fail.”</p>

<p>And one bright, calm summer noon, as they were
passing a thick grove of oaks, there was heard, far
away, the sound of a wood-cutter’s axe.</p>

<p>They called out, as was their custom, “Tirra,
Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!” and then stood listening.</p>

<p>“Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!” they heard in
reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“That’s not an echo!” cried the boy; “call
again!”</p>

<p>They called again, all together, very loud: “Tirra,
Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!”</p>

<p>The answer came back in a clear, strong voice,
and much nearer than before.</p>

<p>Then a crashing of branches was heard, and a
stout man burst through.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>At first he could not speak, from astonishment.
But at last he caught the two children in his arms,
kissed them, hugged them, wept over them, and
called them his precious, precious children.</p>

<p>And Rosebud, seeing that they both were crying
for joy, herself stepped forward and told their story.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>THE CAVE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Robbers’ Road, spoken of in the beginning,
could never have been called by that name
without some reason.</p>

<p>Before the father of the Lily Queen built this
summer palace for his children, there dwelt in Long
Forest a band of robbers. So numerous and so
bold were they, that few travellers dared trust themselves
in the neighborhood, and the road through
the forest was called the Robbers’ Road.</p>

<p>But before bringing his bride to the new palace,
Brondé sent troops of soldiers thither, who scoured
the forest, and dispersed the band.</p>

<p>It happened that, after many years had passed, a
portion of these robbers found their way back.
They were cautious at first, and wary, but grew
bolder as their numbers increased; and, at the time
of which we are speaking, their operations were
seriously felt by the shepherds, the farmers, and the
woodmen.</p>

<p>Their head-quarters were in a large cave. There
they plotted mischief and divided the spoils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>It was in this cave that, late one summer’s night,
they came together, each bringing with him the
booty he had secured during the day. Blazing
torches hung around on the dark walls. In the
corners were piles of grain, fruit, meats, stolen from
the farmers; also bags and portmanteaus taken
from unfortunate travellers.</p>

<p>They gathered about the long table,—tall, gaunt
figures, with dark faces,—they gathered about the
long table with but few words, for they had travelled
fast and far, and were eager for food.</p>

<p>When their appetites were satisfied, their captain
drew forth a heavy bag, from which he emptied a
heap of gold. Half of this he locked up in an iron
box, and was proceeding to divide the remainder,
when, chancing to raise his eyes, he saw, standing
at the foot of the table, a man of great size, dressed
in skins and well armed. A company of men,
dressed and armed like himself, but inferior in size,
were stealing softly into the cave and grouping
themselves around him.</p>

<p>“Betrayed!” shouted the robbers; and each man
felt for his sword.</p>

<p>But the fierce-looking stranger threw down his
arms, bade his followers do the same, and, waving
his hand to the company, said:—</p>

<p>“No, not betrayed. We are no spies, but, on the
contrary, would become your friends. Listen, now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
for a while, that I may show you how well we shall
agree, and that our interests are the same. Do you
love a wild life, and to be your own masters?”</p>

<p>“We do.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Do you like plenty of gold, good
living, and light labor?”</p>

<p>“We do.”</p>

<p>“So do I. Do you care for law?”</p>

<p>“We do not.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. For knowledge?”</p>

<p>“We do not.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I. For goodness?”</p>

<p>“We do not.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I, my friends. And now another
question. Do you hate King Brondé?”</p>

<p>“We do!” they exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Do you wish his destruction?”</p>

<p>“We do.”</p>

<p>“Will you do your best to accomplish this?”</p>

<p>“We will! We will!” they cried.</p>

<p>“And so will I. You see, now, how well we are
agreed, and that our interests are the same. My
name is Magnus. These are my trusty followers.
Shake hands, my brave fellows. Right! We are
brothers now. You hate King Brondé, because it
was to make room for him that your once powerful
band was dispersed. Many of you mourn the loss
of friends, comrades, kindred, slain by his orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“True! True!” they cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, true,” exclaimed Magnus. “And I hate
King Brondé because he is richer and luckier than
myself. There is no reason why I should not have
wedded a princess and inherited a kingdom. I am
as strong to protect, as brave to defend. And I seek
his death; for, when he is gone, I need not then
say, ‘I am the largest and strongest man living,
except—’; but, ‘I am the largest and strongest
man living,’—and nothing more. I have a plan,
my friends, which I will now unfold to you.”</p>

<p>This speech was received with cheers and wild
hurrahs; but Magnus, with a wave of his hand,
said:—</p>

<p>“Quietly, my brave fellows. Our time is not
yet. Nothing can be done openly. King Brondé
is surrounded by brave soldiers, who would shed
for him their last drop of blood. Listen now.”</p>

<p>There was then deep silence in the cave, while
Magnus, in a long speech, unfolded his plans.</p>

<p>But what those plans were, need not here be related,
since all who read further will discover for
themselves.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>MEETING OF THE FAIRIES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW on this very night the Green Fairy was
holding her court in Daisy Hollow, deep in
the forest. How lovely were these pretty creatures,
as they appeared, one after another, their bright
wings fluttering, and glistening with dew!</p>

<p>Truly fairy-like were their greetings! A mortal,
listening near, might have supposed he heard only
the sighing of the summer breeze, the murmur of
brooklets, or the far-off tinkling of little bells.</p>

<p>But their queen allowed them very little time for
greeting. For it had been long since they met, and
much was to be told and much heard, before the
dawn. She therefore began singing:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Where the softest grass is found,</div>
<div class="verse">Quickly form your circle round.</div>
<div class="indent4">Let each one say,</div>
<div class="indent4">E’er the dawning of day,</div>
<div class="verse">What wonderful things she has seen on her way.</div>
<div class="verse">Through meadow and wildwood ye’ve been on the wing,</div>
<div class="verse">What news do ye bring? What news do ye bring?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>They then began telling, each in turn, of all their
adventures since the last meeting. And, at last, one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
little pink fairy jumped up briskly, singing thus;
and, as she sang, a little attendant fairy echoed her
last words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I know a cave in the forest deep,</div>
<div class="indent11">Forest deep,</div>
<div class="verse">Where a wicked band their revels keep,</div>
<div class="indent11">Revels keep.</div>
<div class="verse">Old Magnus now has joined them too,</div>
<div class="indent11">Joined them too,</div>
<div class="verse">With his bold and fearless crew,</div>
<div class="indent11">Fearless crew.</div>
<div class="verse">I scented mischief in the air,</div>
<div class="indent11">In the air.</div>
<div class="verse">There’s mighty mischief brewing there,</div>
<div class="indent11">Brewing there.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now, when the Green Fairy heard this, she
quickly broke up the court. For Magnus’s hatred
of King Brondé was well known to her; and, although
ignorant of his plans, yet she knew very
well whose life they would endanger.</p>

<p>In the shape of an owl she flew into the cave,
and there, perched on a rock near the roof, she listened
while Magnus made known to the company
his intentions with regard to King Brondé and his
court.</p>

<p>Next day, changing herself to a beautiful bird,
she flew swiftly to the palace, where the queen was
sitting with her ladies upon the balcony. And
while flying over their heads, she sang thus:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“There is danger in the air.</div>
<div class="verse">Lily Queen, beware, beware!</div>
<div class="verse">Danger dark to one you love;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him not afar to rove;</div>
<div class="verse">Bid him keep a watchful care;</div>
<div class="verse">There is danger in the air!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>None but the queen understood the song. The
ladies only said, “Truly a pretty bird, and a sweet
singer!” and wondered why it was that their Lily
Queen turned so deadly pale and left them so hastily.</p>

<p>She ran swiftly through the rooms of the palace,
found the king in his private apartments, and eagerly
told him of the beautiful bird and its warning song.</p>

<p>But when the king learned that the others had
only heard sweet music, he treated the matter rather
lightly, thinking it to be merely her fancy. What
could a little woman fear, he said, who had a husband
so big and strong! But, that she might be
comforted, he promised to be watchful, and not to
roam about the forest unattended. If he had only
known what we know, he would have sent to the
city for a strong army of soldiers, who could easily
have taken possession of the cave and routed the
whole band.</p>

<p>But, as he did not know, he only took his Lily
Queen upon his knee, and there they sat, a long,
long time, talking of their sweet little Rosebud, and
of old times, and of the good king, her father, and
how she was near dying in the rocky chasm. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
then, as she felt his brown curls brushing her cheek,
she confessed, for the first time, the trick she played
him on their way from the mountains. But I don’t
believe he was at all angry with her,—do you?</p>

<p>Not long after this, as the king and all his court
were amusing themselves one fine morning on the
lawn, in front of the palace, there came running in
among them a wood-cutter, crying out that two
lions had been seen in the forest! Then ran every
man for his bow and spear, the king as swift as any.
All were eager for the hunt, but the queen was full
of alarm. She wept, and, clasping the hands of her
husband, begged him to remain. But this, of course,
he would not do. What were a couple of lions to
a strong man like him?</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>GOING A HUNTING, AND WHAT CAME OF IT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW these were the orders which Magnus had
given to his company.</p>

<p>First, no blood must be shed. King Brondé’s
men were to be carried off prisoners to his strong
castle, in a far country,—an immense castle, whose
walls were of such thickness, and so well defended,
that the king of the country himself dared not
attack it. The ladies of the court were also to be
taken to the castle, and even their children. For
all these prisoners, Magnus expected that heavy
ransoms would be offered in silver and gold. King
Brondé, loaded with chains, would be confined in
the cave, until Magnus should decide the manner
of his death. As for the lower people, the wood-cutters,
foresters, laborers, they must also be carried
off with the rest, as laboring men were much needed
at the castle.</p>

<p>But in the first place Magnus sent a message to
the powerful band he had left behind, commanding
that one hundred of his strongest, boldest men,
well armed, should come to him without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>As soon as this order was received, one hundred
strong, bold men, well armed, mounted their fleetest
horses, and rode night and day until they reached
the cave.</p>

<p>Spies were then sent out, with orders to watch
the movements of King Brondé, and to give timely
notice whenever he should go forth to hunt.</p>

<p>But a whole week passed, and still the wished-for
notice was not given.</p>

<p>“King Brondé is weary of hunting deer,” said
one of the men, as they were gathered, one evening,
in the cave.</p>

<p>“If that be so,” cried Magnus, “why, we can
easily manage a lion or two.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He then made a sign to one of his men, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
suddenly gave such a terrible roar that the whole
company sprang to their feet, thinking there was
surely a lion near.</p>

<p>Magnus then took some skins, and had them
stuffed so well that they might easily, at a distance,
be taken for lions.</p>

<p>Not long after this the most terrible roarings
were heard in the forest, and on several occasions,
when the wood-cutters were walking homeward at
twilight, the stuffed lions were popped out so suddenly
before them, with such awful roarings, that
they ran home almost out of their wits, and with
scarcely breath enough to tell the story.</p>

<p>This trick of the robbers accomplished their purpose.
The wood-cutter, with his story, startled the
whole court. All were eager to join the lion hunt;
and, in an hour’s time after the alarm was given,
lords, high captains, knights, squires, pages, foresters,
woodmen, were scouring the forest in every
direction.</p>

<p>It was a fine, breezy day. The skies were clear,
the sun shone brightly, birds sang sweetly. The
horses were fleet, the hearts of the huntsmen were
light and gay. Baying of hounds, merry shouts
and bugle calls, resounded through the forest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Orders had been given that at midday all should
assemble at Daisy Hollow, there to report progress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
and to partake of the refreshment which must at
that time be needed.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the time appointed, they began
to appear, one after another, at this rendezvous,
and to relate their adventures.</p>

<p>It seemed that but little had been done. One
had seen a tail, another a head, many had heard
roarings, and many had neither seen nor heard anything
at all. Provisions were spread upon the
grass, and, after eating and drinking, the whole
company joined in singing a hunting-song.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, Magnus’s men had quietly formed
a circle around the Hollow, and were eagerly
awaiting from their leader the signal to advance.
Magnus had ordered that each should select his
man, he himself taking King Brondé. But knowing
that the strength of his rival fully equalled his
own, he had selected from the company ten stout
men to assist him.</p>

<p>While the hunting party were gayly eating and
drinking, the circle had been gradually closing
around them. As soon as the singing began, Magnus
waved his sword. This was the signal agreed
upon, and the wild crew crept stealthily forward
among the trees, now flat upon the grass, now over
rocks, and now forcing with their swords a way
through tangled thickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>And at last, just as the chorus of the merry band
rang loudly and cheerily out, they burst with loud
cries from the wood, and in an instant each one of
the hunters found himself laid prostrate upon the
ground, a powerful foot upon his breast, a sharp
knife at his throat. And so quickly and so skilfully
was this accomplished, that hardly a single drop of
blood had been shed.</p>

<p>The moment that King Brondé saw the powerful
form bending over him, he knew well who was his
enemy. Exerting all his immense strength, he
endeavored to set himself free. But Magnus was
armed, and had strength fully equal to his own.
He was also assisted by the ten picked men.</p>

<p>King Brondé, recollecting the little vial hanging
at his neck, contrived to draw it forth, and was in
the act of drawing out the cork with his teeth, when
Magnus, who knew its contents, snatched it away,
at the same time breaking the cord.</p>

<p>But in the contest the little vial fell to the
ground. Magnus vainly sought it, for one of
Brondé’s men, who had in some way escaped from
his captor, very cunningly, with the tip of his
sword, rolled it under a plantain-leaf. When the
search was over, he hid it in his bosom, and amid the
confusion contrived to make his way unnoticed to
the woods, and so escaped.</p>

<p>King Brondé and his men were taken to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
cave, and there made to exchange clothes with
their captors. Magnus cut off King Brondé’s fair
curls, and covered with them his own coarse black
locks, that the Lily Queen might suppose him to be
the real Brondé.</p>

<p>The robbers then, clothed in the garments of
their prisoners, and bearing their bows and spears,
marched boldly to the palace. Now the queen and
all her ladies were met upon the Velvet Lawn, near
the palace, where they were amusing themselves by
shooting at a mark. They wore dresses of pure
white, their heads were adorned with wreaths of
flowers, and about their waists were green garlands.
Their arrows were silver-tipped, and their bows
decked with ribbons. But the dress of Rosebud
was green, besprinkled with diamonds like dew-drops
on the grass. For she was always dressed in
this color, in remembrance of the Green Fairy.</p>

<p>The robbers approached, amid the winding of
horns and bugle-blasts.</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Rosebud, “I see my stout, handsome
father coming!” And she was off like an
arrow to meet him.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” cried the queen; “there are my
Brondé’s fair curls. And there is the red feather I
placed this morning in his cap!”</p>

<p>Ah, poor Rosebud! And ah, poor Lily Queen!
In one short hour after this, queen, ladies, servants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
children, laborers,—all were prisoners! All bound,
and on their way to some gloomy castle belonging
to Magnus. Also the costly treasures of the palace,
the gold, the jewels, the ermine robes,—everything
of value which could be taken.</p>

<p>One precious thing only was left, and this precious
thing was the king’s Rosebud.</p>

<p>It happened in this way.</p>

<p>Rosebud, with outstretched arms, ran to meet her
father, her face beaming with joy, her heart brimming
over with love for him. He had returned!—returned
safe! Nothing had happened to him
in the forest.</p>

<p>“Dear, dear father!” she cried.</p>

<p>As we all know, however, it was not really her
father, but the wicked Magnus.</p>

<p>Now, when this wicked Magnus looked down into
the face of Rosebud, he beheld there something
which he never saw before. He had seen courage,
he had seen strength, he had seen bravery; but a
deep, o’erflowing love, like that expressed in the
flushed and beaming face before him, he had never
yet known.</p>

<p>And while he secured her as his prisoner, and
saw her tears, and the horror and affright with
which she regarded him, he felt a strange desire
creeping into his heart to bring back that same look
again; and, more than this, to have that beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
look meant, really meant, for himself. That grim,
bad man actually felt that the love of a little child
would be a pleasant thing to have!</p>

<p>“Very soon,” said he to himself, “she will have
neither father nor mother. I can very well manage
that. I will then provide for her a beautiful abode,
and give her many pretty things, gay toys, fine
clothes, and she shall call me father. And when I
come home she will run with outstretched arms,
and with a shining face, and will say, ‘Dear, dear
father!’”</p>

<p>Rosebud, therefore, was not sent away with the
rest, but was placed on a bed, in an upper chamber,
all by herself, with the door locked.</p>

<p>And in the middle of the night there came a
stout man into the chamber, who lifted her from the
bed, saying:—</p>

<p>“I am sent by the great Magnus. You need not
struggle, for I am strong; nor cry aloud, for there
are none to hear you; and you need not fear, for
no harm will befall you.”</p>

<p>So Rosebud lay quite still in his arms, like a
wounded bird, while he trudged stoutly on, till they
came to a place in the woods where stood three men
by a litter. Into this litter Rosebud was placed, and
the four men, each bearing one end of a pole, went
on as rapidly as the path would admit.</p>

<p>On they travelled, day after day, a weary, weary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
way. But Rosebud cared little for weariness. She
mourned for her father, whose fate was not known to
her, and for her mother in the power of that cruel
man.</p>

<p>But so tender and so full of love was her little
heart, that she could not help pitying the men who
had to carry her so far. And she spoke so gently,
and smiled so sweetly, in the midst of her grief, that
even those wild robbers were softened. They
moved her tenderly, they placed soft furs about her,
and plucked, now and then, some pretty flower
which grew by the wayside, well pleased if she but
smiled in return.</p>

<p>And one of these, the guide, whose name was Rupert,
resolved that Rosebud should not be taken to
Magnus, but that he himself would keep her for his
own. He had once been a simple-minded, laboring
man, and had joined the robbers only from being
pressed by poverty. What though outwardly rough
and ungainly, his heart was kind, and so wholly
drawn to Rosebud, that he could not see her come
to harm. He was weary of roving, weary of strife.
He would quit the castle, and in some other kingdom
would lead an honest life; and Rosebud should
be his own child, his pleasant little companion. He
would go forth mornings, to work for food; she would
tidy up the house and welcome him back with
smiles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Now this fine little plan was not fully carried out.
A beginning, however, was made, as will now be
related.</p>

<p>One night, after weeks of weary journeying,—not
in the direction of the castle, however, Rupert
had seen to that,—after weeks of weary journeying,
they stopped by the edge of a wood for a few hours’
sleep. Rosebud was lying in her litter, upon the
ground. A lion-skin was thrown over her, as a
protection from the night dews.</p>

<p>She heard the deep breathing of the men around
her, and knew that they were asleep. And as she
lay there, quite still, looking up through the branches
at the twinkling stars, listening to the rustling of the
leaves as the night wind blew over them, she heard,
so it seemed to her, a whispering or murmuring
voice, which appeared to come from a tall, flowering
shrub growing near, whose blossoms were white in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>A soft, silvery voice it was, but Rosebud, listening
carefully, could distinguish words like these:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Be of good cheer,</div>
<div class="verse">O maiden dear;</div>
<div class="verse">No longer fear,</div>
<div class="verse">For help is near.”</div>
</div></div>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i058.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Rosebud opened wide her eyes to make sure it was
not a dream. But no, there were the stars, the
rustling leaves, and the sleeping men around her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>Presently a whiskered
face was brought
close to her own, and a
voice whispered, “Do
not speak; I am your
true friend.” She then
felt herself lifted up and
borne swiftly through
the bushes.</p>

<p>After some time, she was laid gently upon the
ground and felt herself sinking, sinking, very slowly,
into a deep hole in the earth. But the bottom was
covered thick with leaves and soft grass; Rosebud,
therefore, was not at all hurt, but very much frightened;
for why should a true friend bury her up?</p>

<p>Rupert, for it was he who was the true friend,
then drew a fallen tree over the hole, in such a manner
that the air could easily make its way through,
and then, with all speed, he joined his comrades by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
the edge of the woods. He lay quietly down among
them, and, being very tired from the long journey,
fell sound asleep.</p>

<p>At daylight he was aroused by the voices of his
companions calling upon him to rise quickly and
help to find their little prisoner, who had escaped, or
had been carried away, during the night. Rupert
then ran eagerly about among the trees, taking care
to go always in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>After long searching, they became weary and
resolved to seek no longer. For, said they, whatever
may be her fate, the child cannot fare worse
than if in the hands of Magnus.</p>

<p>But, in order to escape his anger, they agreed to
leave the country and never return.</p>

<p>Now Rupert, as soon as the other three were at a
safe distance, ran quickly to release Rosebud. She
was fast asleep!</p>

<p>Some miles distant, close by the sea-shore, dwelt
an old woman, who, in her youth, had been the
friend of Rupert’s mother; and it was in her care
that for the present he had determined to leave
Rosebud. He remained in the woods through the
day, and at night took his little girl in his arms, and
carried her safely to the hut of this old woman. It
was his plan to leave her here, while he sought, in
some distant country, employment by which to support
both her and himself. He would then claim
and keep her for his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>So Rosebud was left in the hut by the sea-shore,
where she had some truly wonderful adventures, all
of which will be told at a proper time. We must
now see what became of King Brondé, whom we
left with his men in the Robbers’ Cave.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>ESCAPING FROM PERILS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL the other prisoners were carried away to the
castle, but King Brondé was left,—left alone in
the cave. This was because it would take too many
men to guard him on the road. A strong band
were to return for him. He was, therefore, dragged
to the deepest depths of the cave, far from the light
of day, and there securely bound. Magnus, then,
with his immense strength, and the assistance of
his men, heaped up at the entrance such a mountain
of rocks, earth, and trees as would require an
army of men to remove.</p>

<p>Now while the robbers, in the depths of the cave;
were roughly fastening their chains around good
King Brondé, he observed that one among them,
who was very busy at his right arm, seemed much
fiercer than the rest, much more eager to bind him.
And when, at one time, this very zealous robber
rudely thrust his hand beneath the robe of the king,
and directly over his heart, Brondé was sure that he
meant, with some hidden weapon, to deal him his
death-blow. But the hand was quickly withdrawn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and King Brondé felt that it had left something in
his bosom. Some deadly poison, he feared it was,
which, working by slow degrees, would destroy his
life. Still he showed no fear, nor asked for mercy,
for freedom, or for life.</p>

<p>And when the last man had disappeared, and he
was left alone, a prisoner, chained, buried in the
depths of the earth, he by no means despaired. A
few glaring pine torches still blazed upon the walls,
and he resolved that, while these yet burned, he
would exert his strength to the utmost in an effort
to burst his chains. Once freed from these, he was
possessed of a secret, by means of which he was
sure of escaping.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i062.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>To his surprise and joy, on moving very slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
his right arm, the chain dropped! His right arm
was free! He quickly drew forth from his bosom
what had been so mysteriously placed there. It was
a rude box, made of dark wood. He must have
touched some hidden spring, for the lid flew up, and
he beheld there the vial which had been lost in the
fight.</p>

<p>As he joyfully seized this lost treasure, now become
doubly precious, he touched another spring.
A second lid flew up, and he saw within a half-blown
rosebud and a pure white lily, side by side.
With tears of joy he kissed the pretty flowers, emblems
of his dear wife and child, and his heart was
comforted. For he had yet a friend able to assist
him,—a friend who would care for his loved ones.</p>

<p>The mystery of this friend may as well be explained
at once, and now. He was the wood-cutter,
whose little boy and girl Rosebud had saved from
the boat,—that little boy and girl with whom she
ran, hand in hand, along the forest paths, calling as
they ran, “Tirra, Tirra, Tirra, Tirra La!” She
was kind and good to them always, and he felt
grateful, and longed to do her a service. When
King Brondé was overpowered in Green Hollow, on
the day of the lion hunt, he kept close by his side.
It was he, who, with the tip of his sword, thrust the
little vial under the plantain-leaf, and afterwards escaped
with it. After the robbers had exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
clothes with their prisoners, they were, of course,
dressed like himself. He then went boldly among
them and heard all their plans. As Magnus offered
great rewards for the lost vial, he felt sure it contained
some secret charm, and resolved to restore it
to King Brondé. He was the very zealous robber
who was so eager to secure the right arm of the
king, but who, in reality, left the chain unfastened.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>King Brondé, now, his right arm free, his lost
treasure restored, felt sure of escaping. He swallowed
a few drops of the liquid, and then, making
one powerful effort, burst his chains and stood once
more erect with limbs unbound!</p>

<p>After this, he lay for hours in a heavy sleep, or
stupor. Upon awakening, he found himself in complete
darkness, the torches having burnt out long
before. After groping in the dark for some time, he
succeeded in finding the spot where the entrance had
been, but the masses of rock there heaped up were
as firm as were the solid walls. He felt for his vial,
but it was gone. It had, no doubt, dropped upon
the ground, during that long sleep, and afterwards
been crushed beneath his heavy tread, for not a trace
of it was ever found.</p>

<p>But, as has been mentioned, he was possessed of
a secret, by means of which he might escape.</p>

<p>It appears that, long before, and at the time their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
summer palace had been built by the father of his
Lily Queen, King Brondé had often, while his
men were ranging in the forest, examined this cave
in every part, and, being exceedingly tall, had
made a discovery. And it was by means of this
discovery that he now proposed to gain his freedom.</p>

<p>Climbing up, several yards from the ground, he
reached an opening which extended, not upwards,
but horizontally, for thirty feet or more. Through
this he crept, until he came to a second opening,
which led upwards. Through this he began climbing,
but soon found, to his sorrow, that it was filled
with rocks and earth.</p>

<p>This opening was, no doubt, a private entrance to
the cave, known only to the leaders of the first band
of robbers, until accidentally discovered by King
Brondé.</p>

<p>The obstructions which now filled this opening
he, with great labor, at length removed. As there
was no means of telling day from night, it was impossible
to know how much time was thus consumed.
By degrees he worked his way upwards, taking no
rest, and at last felt himself grasping the roots of
trees. And presently after, to his great joy, he
perceived a ray of light! A faint, feeble ray, but
it came, as he knew, from the warm sun and through
the free air! Redoubling now his exertions, he
pressed upwards, and not many hours elapsed before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
he sprang forth into the open air, and stood, a free
man, upon the side of the mountain!</p>

<p>Not knowing how many of his enemies might be
near, he concealed himself until evening, and then
cautiously approached his palace. He watched and
listened long, but saw no light, heard no sound.
What, then, had become of all the ladies of the
court? of his own Lily and precious Rosebud? He
entered the palace, wandered through its deserted
chambers, but found none to answer the questions
he was so eager to ask.</p>

<p>He stood long by the window, gazing at the desolate
scene around, vainly striving to think calmly,
that he might decide upon some plan of action.
The moon shone brightly, lighting up the deserted
lawn, the woodland paths, the pleasant groves which
had once rung with the music of happy voices! He
heard the bleating of a goat near. It was a little
white goat, belonging to Rosebud, and which she
had fed daily. O, where was Rosebud now?</p>

<p>In his despair he was about to rush from the palace,
when his attention was arrested by a noise like
that of distant music. As it grew nearer, he could
plainly distinguish the roll of drums. Nearer, still,
it came, and he saw the glitter of spears in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>“Magnus,” said he, “has returned; I will conceal
myself.” He looked again. O, the joyful surprise!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
They were his own soldiers!—his City Guards!
On they came, covering the vast lawn before the
palace, the wide meadows, and reaching, he could
not tell how far, into the woods beyond!</p>

<p>Now who had sent this army to the rescue of
King Brondé? It was that same true friend, the
wood-cutter. He had hastened to the city and
sounded the alarm. The soldiers of the City Guard
heard, in the dead hours of the night, loud cries.</p>

<p>“The king! The king is in danger! Arouse!
The king! The king is buried alive! To arms!
To arms!” And thus the whole city was aroused,
and the City Guards marched with all speed to
Long Forest. But when they saw him, alive and
well, standing between the great brazen lions which
guarded the palace gate, they were overcome with
joy, and made the forest ring with cries and loud
huzzas!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will now relate how the castle of Magnus was
burned, and his prisoners set free.</p>

<p>King Brondé first learned from the wood-cutter
the name of the country to which the robbers had
fled with their prisoners. He then sent messengers
to the king of that country, saying that he should
come with his soldiers to rescue his family and his
people, and demanding help.</p>

<p>Now this king was feeble, both in mind and body,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and had by no means a large army at his command.
He was, therefore, well pleased that King Brondé
should unite with him to break up that powerful
band of robbers, who, entrenched in their strong
castle, had grown so strong and bold, that they were
the terror of the whole country, defying the king
and all his soldiers.</p>

<p>These two kings, then, with their two armies,
marched boldly to the castle. The robbers, fearing
no danger, had set no watchmen upon the towers.
They were surprised and captured. Their prisoners
were found confined, far apart from each other,
in dismal cells. These were set free, while Magnus
and all his men were carried off in chains, by the
king of the country. The castle was then set on
fire. This all took place in the night.</p>

<p>As may well be imagined, there were many joyful
meetings among the prisoners. Husbands and
wives, parents and children, brothers and sisters,
rushed to embrace each other. King Brondé
pressed to his heart the pale Lily Queen, with tears
of joy. And next the two elder princesses were
folded in his arms.</p>

<p>“But where is Rosebud?” he cried, looking
eagerly among the crowd.</p>

<p>And, “Where is Rosebud?” asked the Lily
Queen of the king.</p>

<p>Alas, neither of them could tell where was
Rosebud!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>And all were certain that it was not known even
to Magnus himself, for many inquiries about her
had been made by him, and large rewards offered,
but all in vain. It was known that four men had
set out with her from Long Forest, but not one
of these four men had been heard from since.
Grateful, then, as were the king and queen at
being restored to each other, their return home
was but sorrowful, for the joy of their life, their
darling Rosebud, was lost to them, and O, would
she ever, ever be found?</p>

<p>But King Brondé and his soldiers and the whole
assembly must now depart for their own country.
Trumpets were sounded, drums beaten, bugle calls
rang loud and clear, and at dawn of the day word
was given to move forward.</p>

<p>Thus, with the blazing castle behind them, and
the glowing eastern sky before, they began their
journey home. A happy journey to the husbands
and wives, parents and children, so lately reunited,
but full of sadness to King Brondé and his Lily
Queen, mourning for their lost Rosebud!</p>

<p>Let us leave them, now, to find their way back
to Long Forest, while we learn how it fares with
their child, in the hut of the old woman.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>LIFE AT THE SEA-SHORE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Rupert had known more of this old woman,
he certainly would not have left Rosebud in
her care. The place where she lived was under
the control of a powerful lord, or governor, appointed
by the king of that country. This lord
had in various parts of his dominions curious little
stone cages, very small stone cages, in which he
shut up such as offended him; and of one of these
our old woman was the keeper. They were very
mysterious cages. No one knew where they were,
except their owner, their prisoners, and their keepers.
The approach to them was hidden. Several
of these were placed in an extensive wood, which
could be seen from the hut. It was called the
Enchanted Wood.</p>

<p>It was called the Enchanted Wood, on account
of sounds frequently heard there; sometimes singing,
sometimes notes of a musical instrument,
and at other times sorrowful moans. The prisoners
could, of course, have explained these sounds;
but as they were not free to do it, and no one else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
could or would, it happened that the place obtained
the name of the Enchanted Wood. Besides being
the keeper of one of these cages, our old woman
was friendly with a number of bad characters from
whom she received stolen money and jewels, which
she hid for them in the cellar beneath her hut.
She was a little bent old woman, with thin gray
locks about her withered face, and always wore a
small blue blanket pinned over her head. Being
lame, she never went without her staff.</p>

<p>“What are you crying for?” she said, as Rosebud
sat weeping, after Rupert had said good by.
“What are you crying for? there, go to bed.”
And she pushed open the door of a closet which
contained one stool, and one little mattress of straw,
and one very small square window.</p>

<p>This was the best she could give Rosebud,—Rosebud,
so lately come from the splendid chambers,
the velvet cushions, the decorated walls, the
lofty ceilings, the soft couches of a palace, where
helpful servants were glad to do her bidding, and
where, better than all, she was blest with the love
of her dear father and mother. Poor little Rosebud!
She thought, while crying herself to sleep,
that she would gladly live in the hut, could she
but see the pale face of her mother bending over
her for a good-night kiss, or lay her weary head
upon her father’s big shoulder, and feel his arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
clasped lovingly around her. But Rosebud had
become quite accustomed to crying herself to sleep
now, and, being weary from so long a journey, was
soon quite unconscious whether she were in a hut
or a palace.</p>

<p>The next morning she found that three grandchildren
lived with the old woman,—a girl named
Bess, another girl named Judy, and a little boy
called Grump. She could hear them from her
room, quarrelling over their breakfast, calling each
other names, while the old woman scolded or beat
them with her staff.</p>

<p>Rosebud opened her door and stood among them
with that same sweet, innocent look which had
already won so many hearts, and spoke to them
pleasantly. The children gazed upon her with
wonder, their rude voices hushed. It was as if
some rare flower had suddenly bloomed out before
them, or some sweet song-bird had alighted there!</p>

<p>After breakfast she was ordered to help scour
the platters, sand the floor, wash the potatoes, and
drive the geese to water, and then to go with the
others to pick up drift-wood.</p>

<p>Drift-wood is whatever bits of board, sticks, or
timber the waves throw up and leave upon the
sand. This drift-wood was collected at low water,
dried in the sun, and supplied the people of the
shore with their winter’s fuel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Rosebud was delighted with this employment.
The ocean was new to her, and she was never tired
of looking at the foaming, tumbling waves, the sea-birds
skimming over the water, the far-off white-sailed
ships, or the smaller boats tossing up and
down near the shore. For the beach was inhabited
by fishermen who owned a great many boats.
She longed to be in one of these, and sit riding all
so lightly upon the waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i073.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And Grump promised to give her a boat-ride,
for he could manage an oar very well.</p>

<p>“But not now,” said he, “while granny is watching,
for if too little wood is got, then she will beat
us. But when she goes to the town, then we’ll go,
up and down, up and down, all day long. Shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
you like that? What a funny name! Rosebud!
Where did you come from? How white your face
is! All but your cheeks, and they are the color
of these pink shells! And what a pretty green
robe!”</p>

<p>But Rosebud did not tell Grump where she came
from. Rupert had told her it would not be well
for the old woman to find it out. For she might
take her to Magnus, in hopes of a reward.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rosebud very soon became accustomed to the life
of the shore, could run about on the sands barefoot,
and lift her basketful with the rest. She never
grew weary of watching the sea when the wind was
high, or of picking up shells in the sands, or of being
rowed about in the little boats by Grump, in the
calm summer afternoons when work was over.
Still, she had many sad hours, and would have had
many more, only for the company of Grump, who
was always full of talk, and ready to help.</p>

<p>“O, if I only had a white face,” said he one day.
“A white face is so pretty. Would granny be very
angry, Rosebud, if I washed my face again?”</p>

<p>Rosebud laughed at this.</p>

<p>“And why should your granny be angry?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Bess took some soap one day,” said he, “and
scrubbed my face, and it turned very red, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
very white, and granny came home from the town,
and she beat me for it with her cane, and shut me
up for a great many days. It was very long ago,
but I have not forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Rosebud; “if shut up, you
can still hear the dashing of the waves, and I will
sit and sing beneath your window. And you would
have no wood to fetch. Come, here is a spring,
and pray be in haste.”</p>

<p>Then Grump began scrubbing. And his face
first became red and then white, and at last a beautiful
red and white. His eyes were blue, like Rosebud’s,
but darker. There was a color in his cheeks,
like Rosebud’s, but brighter. His curls were shorter
than Rosebud’s, and thicker and browner, and were
pushed back from his broad white forehead, while
hers drooped in ringlets about her face. He had
a round, rosy mouth, and two pretty rows of white
teeth, the same as Rosebud.</p>

<p>“Now, that is good,” cried Rosebud. “And
you look much too pretty to be called Grump. I
must think of some nicer name than that for so nice
a boy. What shall I call you?”</p>

<p>“Call me something that goes well with Rosebud,”
said Grump; “for now that you are come, I shall
work with you more than anybody, and play with you
more than anybody, for I like you more than anybody.
Rosebud, I like you very much indeed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“That is very kind of you,” said Rosebud. “I
wonder what we shall call you. What does go well
with Rosebud?”</p>

<p>Grump couldn’t think of anything that went so
much with rosebuds as thorns. But that would
not do, for Rosebud said he was not in the least
like a thorn. At length she remembered a very
pretty song she had heard about the rose and the
myrtle. Suppose he should be called Myrtle.
How would he like that? O, very much, very
much indeed. And thus it was agreed that he
should be called Myrtle.</p>

<p>But granny did not shut the boy up or even
notice him at all. She probably had other matters
to trouble her. For every day she came home
very cross from the town, and sat crouching in the
corner, muttering, and poking the ashes with her
cane. Perhaps some prisoner had escaped from
her stone cage. Or perhaps she had heard that
the owners of the stolen jewels she had hidden
were in search of them. No one could tell.</p>

<p>So Myrtle grew cleaner and prettier and happier
every day. And strangers, walking upon the
beach, often stopped to wonder at the strange loveliness
of the little barefoot boy and girl, as they ran
pattering along the sands with their wood-baskets.
Rosebud, with her pleasant face and gentle ways,
soon became a favorite with the children of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
shore. They were all eager to play with her, to
help her pick up wood and moss among the rocks,
to show her where the birds built, and often coaxed
her to their huts, that the family at home might
know this lovely little stranger. Thus she never
lacked for company.</p>

<p>But, as the summer wore away, she sickened for
home and friends, and in the midst of the happy
children felt all, all alone. And one day, one calm,
bright summer day, when she and Myrtle were
floating about in their little boat, which scarcely
moved, so still was the water, she told him her
whole history,—told it with sobs and tears and
broken words, which caused Myrtle to sigh and
weep too, although he strove to talk bravely, and
promised Rosebud that, when he was only one year
older, they would set out together to seek her
friends or to learn their fate. He himself was tired
of their gloomy little hut.</p>

<p>The hut, indeed, was but a cheerless home. For
as months passed, and still Rupert did not appear,
the old woman became angry that Rosebud should
be left so long, and no money sent. And she was
cruel to the child, and laid tasks upon her too
heavy to bear. Bess and Judy, seeing that Rosebud
was better liked than themselves, became envious.
And they, too, gave her rough words and
sometimes blows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>“You pink-faced thing, you! You eat our
bread!” they cried.</p>

<p>But not when Myrtle was by. They did not
dare. Her brave defender was Myrtle; for he believed
the whole world could not produce another
so good, so kind, so lovely as their Rosebud.</p>

<p>Indeed, from the very first, this boy had seemed
to consider himself bound to shield from all harm
the delicate, gentle child, who had come among
them. He performed her rougher tasks, he made
his sisters afraid to ill-use her, and even one day
faced the old woman herself, and, when she was
about to strike Rosebud, caught the staff from her
hand!</p>

<p>So, when he was by, Bess and Judy did not dare
show their ill temper. Neither did they dare give
him any other name than Myrtle when within his
reach. But sometimes, when they were safe behind
granny, they would call him “Grump.” Or,
if he were off a little way from the shore, in his
boat, they would sit upon the rocks, calling out,
“Grump! Grump! how is your health, Grump!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE FLOWER-GARDEN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day Myrtle met Rosebud coming from the
fishermen’s huts, looking quite sorrowful.</p>

<p>“Pretty little Rosebud,” said he, “what troubles
you, I pray?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said Rosebud, “I have now nothing to
bestow. I have seen a little lame child, and a poor,
suffering, sick young maiden, and a pale woman,
dressed all in black, who weeps every day. And I
have nothing to bestow. At the palace were so
many beautiful things, and gold in plenty. The
wood-cutters’ children were so pleased when I
brought them gifts! Now I have nothing! Not
even a flower! But, Myrtle,” she cried, “we will
plant flowers! and they will grow! And we will
gather such sweet nosegays! Nosegays and garlands
for everybody! for all love flowers. Flowers
such as I plucked in my own garden. Bright,
blooming, fragrant flowers!” she continued, mournfully,
her voice growing every moment fainter and
more sorrowful. Myrtle feared she was going to
cry, and so made haste to answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“But we have no seeds. And, besides, winter is
coming; flowers die in the winter.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Rosebud; “we will wait till spring.
The rich man, who lives behind the hill yonder,
has a fine garden. I have looked through at the
beds of flowers, often; and I shall beg seeds from
the gardener.”</p>

<p>“But the dog!” cried Myrtle. “His great,
black, barking dog! he might tear you in pieces!”</p>

<p>“But I shall pat his head,” said Rosebud; “and
I shall say, ‘Good doggie!’ It is not wise to be
always afraid.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Winter was now approaching. Storms were frequent,
cold winds blew, the sea became rough, and
the high waves came roaring, tumbling, foaming to
the shore. Snow fell, fishing-boats were hauled up
out of reach of the tide, and soon the beach was
covered with cakes of ice. The children were often
compelled to remain for days and weeks inside the
hut.</p>

<p>For employment, Rosebud began to make various
things of the shells collected in summer. The sick
girl had taught her. Beautiful shells they were;
pink, yellow, purple, and white, and very pretty
boxes, baskets, vases they made. Even Bess and
Judy begged to learn, and Myrtle helped too.</p>

<p>“And now we have something to bestow!” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
Rosebud, one day. “This, now, shall be for the
little lame child. She will look up so pleasantly,
with her soft brown eyes! And the pale woman in
black, who is weeping always, she shall have this
small, pure white basket. Perhaps she may smile
for once.”</p>

<p>“No!” cried the old woman, looking up from the
ashes,—“no, I say! They shall be sold,—sold in
the town! Can you tell me where your bread is to
come from?”</p>

<p>So all the pretty things were taken to the town
and sold. And the old woman, finding they brought
money, compelled them to work every stormy day
until the shells were gone. But whenever it was
possible to leave the house they were made to pick
up drift-wood as usual. Bitter cold work it was,
creeping among the ice-cakes and over the slippery
rocks!</p>

<p>The days when granny was away were happy
days for them. They could then sing their songs,
tell their stories, play their plays, and invite to their
hut the little children of the shore, without fearing
blows from the old staff.</p>

<p>In the summer Rosebud had taken very little
notice of the doings of granny. She only knew, that,
although appearing quite lame, she went often to the
town; that when at home she did little but poke
in the ashes and smoke her pipe; and now Rosebud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
began to wonder how she fed them all. She spoke
of this to Myrtle, but he only shook his head, and
said granny would not bear to be questioned, and
that she would be very sorry if she made the old
woman angry.</p>

<p>Now, as Rosebud had no wish to make the old
woman angry, she kept her mouth shut, but opened
her eyes very wide, and wondered why granny
muttered so much to herself, and fell asleep often
in her chair, and, when asleep, muttered strange
things, and whose were the voices she heard evenings,
when all the children were in bed?—gruff
men’s voices.</p>

<p>And, when tired of wondering at all these, she
would wonder about Rupert, and why he never had
come for her as he promised, and almost hoped he
would not, now that she had become accustomed
to her new life, and to Myrtle, and to all the children
of the shore, and that there was so much to
be done, when winter was over, about the garden.
She hoped Rupert would leave her there, at least
until the earth had been dug up and the seeds
planted, and the plants came up and budded and
bloomed, and lovely nosegays had been gathered.</p>

<p>Poor Rupert! Rosebud need neither have feared
nor wondered concerning his coming had she known
the ill that had befallen him.</p>

<p>It may be remembered that, when Rosebud was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
taken from the palace, she wore a green dress besprinkled
with diamonds. Now, on the day in which
Rupert had taken her to the hut, while waiting in
the wood for the approach of evening, Rosebud, at
his request, gave him those diamonds, that he might
with them pay the expenses of his journey. And,
had he known their real value, all might have gone
well with him; but, as he by no means knew the
worth of these jewels, all went ill with him.</p>

<p>For at an inn of some great city he offered one
of them for a loaf of bread, two cuts of bacon, and
a night’s lodging.</p>

<p>“You thief!” cried the innkeeper, and called
an officer of justice, who arrested him upon the
spot. The unlucky Rupert was stripped of his jewels
and thrown into prison, where he was lying, sad
and miserable, all the time his little girl was thinking
how strange it was that he came not as he had
promised.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, as spring drew near, Rosebud gave up all her
thinking and her wondering, and began hoping. She
hoped the weather would be mild, hoped granny
would let her have a garden, hoped the dog would
not bite, hoped the gardener would not refuse the
seeds, hoped every one would come up, hoped the
high winds would not blow them over, hoped the
plants would bud, and the buds would blossom, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
the blossoms would look lovely, smell sweet, and
delight everybody.</p>

<p>The snow now began to melt, and the grass to
spring up in the fields above the beach. Leaves
came out upon the trees,—red at first, and tender,
but soon so bright and green that the birds came
back to build among them. The days grew longer,
the sun shone higher in the heavens at noonday.
The fishermen again launched their boats upon the
waters, now no longer dark and ice-bound, but
brightly blue, sparkling in the sunlight.</p>

<p>The planting season had come. There was no
need of longer putting off their grand project. The
ground was already soft. Myrtle thought it better
not to ask granny, lest she should say no, but to
work in the very early mornings, before the others
were stirring. This would not interfere with their
daily tasks.</p>

<p>They dug up the ground, and brought basketfuls
of soil from beyond the beach; for the hut stood in
a barren, sandy spot.</p>

<p>The dog did not bite; he was chained. The
gardener was a rough man. When he saw Rosebud
coming, he caught up his stick, and cried, “Be
off! you—”</p>

<p>But when he looked down into her gentle, pleading
face, as it was upturned to him, he left the sentence
unfinished, and said, quite mildly, “Do you
want anything of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Please, sir, some flower-seeds, for my garden,
sir,” said Rosebud.</p>

<p>“Humph!” cried he. “And what will you
pay?”</p>

<p>“I will pay you two shell-baskets,” said Rosebud,—“a
pink and a white shell-basket; and here they
are,”—for she had made them that morning to
bring.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried he. “These will please my wife!
Here, take the seeds.”</p>

<p>And he gave Rosebud her apron full.</p>

<p>And when Myrtle returned with the old fisherman,
who had before dawn taken him off to fish in
his boat, she ran down to meet him, and to display
all these treasures. And long the two sat together
upon the rocks, gazing with wonder at the tiny
atoms from which such beautiful things were to
grow.</p>

<p>The garden was once more dug over, and its surface
smoothed. And by the next fine day their
seeds were snug in the ground, waiting patiently, as
seeds do always, for their time to come up.</p>

<p>Now that the snow was gone and the weather
mild, the children of the shore could pat along on
the sands again; and, hearing of the wonderful
garden, they came often to the hut, to watch the
planting of the seeds, and to see what might happen
next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>There was great joy, therefore, along the shore,
when the first pale, tender sprouts appeared above
the ground, and all came running to see. For
never before had there been a flower-bed upon the
beach. And as for Rosebud and Myrtle, they
could hardly bear to be a single hour away, lest
some little green stranger should come to town in
their absence.</p>

<p>Those were the days when the pewter platters
got but few scrubbings, and when the broom came
to but little wear; when the pretty shells were neglected,
and the drift-wood was tumbled hastily into
the baskets.</p>

<p>O, when would the flowers come? What color?
How large? Fragrant? Would they last?</p>

<p>“’Twill be a pity to pluck them,” said Rosebud,
“after they have taken so much pains to grow.”</p>

<p>“But then they would die on the stalk, you
know,” said Myrtle.</p>

<p>And it was therefore agreed that the flowers
should be cut off, no matter how lovely.</p>

<p>And many sick people might have been cheered
by them, and many a dark room brightened, had not
something happened to prevent it all. It was a
strange adventure, this that happened to our Rosebud,
and should have a chapter by itself.</p>

<small>A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.</small></h2>
</div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i087.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE night Rosebud
was awakened in
the middle of the night
by the moon shining full
in her face; and, while
lying there awake, she
heard a noise of some
one moving in the next
room. Presently the outer
door shut, and the
footsteps were heard outside.</p>

<p>Rosebud sprang to her
little window, and saw
the old woman hobbling
away quite fast, and carrying
a lighted lantern.</p>

<p>Now Rosebud had, besides
a whole heart full
of love, two other things
very good in their place,
namely, great curiosity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
and great courage. The first of these caused her
to wonder why granny should carry a lighted lantern
on such a bright night, and the second to
follow and find out for herself.</p>

<p>Throwing an old cloak about her, she hastened
out, and caught sight of the old woman disappearing
over the brow of a hill. Running quite fast, she
gained the top, and saw granny with her cane fast
crossing the meadow beyond.</p>

<p>After the meadow came another hill, then a hollow,
then still another hill very steep, and then a
wide strip of barren land called “The Plains.”
Beyond this was the Enchanted Wood. And it
was towards this Wood that the old woman directed
her steps,—Rosebud following not far behind, her
little bare feet never heeding the stones.</p>

<p>But very suddenly granny disappeared. It
seemed to Rosebud that the old woman must have
sunk into the earth. She came to the very spot
where the flutter of her blue blanket had a moment
before been seen, but could find no trace of her.
It was very near the edge of the wood. But
granny could not have entered, for just there the
thicket was thorny and tangled, and not even the
crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf had Rosebud
heard.</p>

<p>“I am very far from home,” thought the little
girl, looking round, “and in the middle of the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
too. But is not the moonlight as safe as the sunlight?
It is surely much prettier.”</p>

<p>Everything was quiet. The trees seemed holding
their branches still for the moon to shine upon
them. How they glistened in its rays! only stirring
a very little now and then, with a rustle, whispering
softly, just to tell what pretty things some
passing zephyr had said to them.</p>

<p>But it suddenly occurred to Rosebud that granny
might reach home by some other way, and find her
room empty. “I will go now,” she thought, “and
return in the morning.”</p>

<p>At the hut all was just as she had left it. She
crept softly into bed, and resolved to lie awake
until granny’s return, but long before daylight was
sound asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, as soon as breakfast was over,
and the old woman had taken her staff, pinned on
her blue blanket, and hobbled off, Rosebud, without
telling Bess or Judy, or even Myrtle,—lest he persuade
her to remain at home,—hastened away over
hills and plains, until she came to the edge of
the Enchanted Wood, where on the night before
granny had so suddenly vanished.</p>

<p>While looking about in search of some hidden
cavern or grotto, she saw lovely flowers growing
among the bushes. These were charming,
and would make fine nosegays or most lovely garlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>She entered the Wood and rambled on and on,
taking any path which offered, and while plucking
the lovely flowers, and also the purple berries, forgot
that the hours were flying so swiftly; and
when at last she became weary, and would have
returned, there appeared no way of getting from the
Wood. Many paths were tried, but all in vain; and
at length, overcome with fatigue, she sank down
upon a mossy bank to rest.</p>

<p>But she was hardly seated before she heard, not
far off, a voice singing. It was a young girl’s voice,
very sweet, but full of sadness.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent5">“Alone, alone!</div>
<div class="verse">Alas, my true love has gone!</div>
<div class="verse">To the wars he is marching on,</div>
<div class="indent5">And I am alone!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Looking in the direction of the voice, Rosebud
saw, a few yards from her, what seemed to be a pile
of rocks surrounded by trees. She stepped softly
that way. When quite near, some one spoke—some
young girl—in gentle tones, and said, “What
do you seek, little one?”</p>

<p>“Only to know who sang so sweetly,” replied
Rosebud, faintly.</p>

<p>“And if you knew,” said the voice, “would you,
if you could, do the singer a service?”</p>

<p>“O yes,” cried Rosebud, “and with all my
heart. But I am only a little girl,—only Rosebud,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
that lives in a little hut upon the sands, with
Bess, and Judy, and Myrtle, and our poor lame
granny.”</p>

<p>“Does your granny wear a blue blanket?” asked
the voice; “and is she a little deaf? and does she
mutter to herself, and carry a staff?”</p>

<p>“How did you know all that?” asked Rosebud.</p>

<p>“Your granny is the keeper of my cage,” replied
the voice. “She comes by night to bring food for
me and my little maid. Come near, Rosebud; you
need not be afraid. I am only a young maiden, not
so very much bigger than yourself. My uncle is
lord of the land here, but not so powerful as my
father, my brave father, who has now gone to the
wars; for he is king, and rules over the whole country.
O, he was loving and kind, and gave to me
jewels and fine clothes in plenty! But, ah! he will
not let me have my true love till one, two, three
years have passed over my head. Yet I can tell
you that I am already very old.</p>

<p>“And, Rosebud, before going to the wars he sent
me to visit my uncle, that I might forget my true
love. And my uncle is a wicked, cruel man, and
a tyrant over me; but I am proud and defy him.
He persuades my father, in his letters, that I am
bad, and will be glad to make him believe this of
me. Were I to die, would he grieve for it? Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
at all; for then he would inherit the kingdom. I
sought to escape, and that is why I am here, although
he says it is that I may forget. Is this
a place to forget? O no. For what says the
song?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first2">‘When the wind goes sobbing by,</div>
<div class="verse">I think my love doth sigh,</div>
<div class="indent5">Doth sigh for me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first2">‘When the sun is brightly gleaming,</div>
<div class="verse">Then I sit, dreaming, dreaming</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first2">‘When the rain-drops tear by tear</div>

<div class="first2">‘When the sea so sadly moans,</div>
<div class="verse">I think in mournful tones</div>
<div class="indent5">He calls for me.’</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“But I will escape from here,” she said, suddenly
ceasing her song. “I will flee to my native
home; for there are those who will be my guides
when once at liberty. And you will do me a service,
Rosebud, as you promised?”</p>

<p>“O yes, indeed!” cried Rosebud; “but how?
Where is the door? Where is your little maid?
What is your name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Bertha. My little maid is asleep.
There is no door,—at least not here. At the edge
of the Wood is a mossy gray rock. Behind this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
rock is a flat stone. Beneath that stone commences
the long underground passage which will lead you
here. But have you courage?”</p>

<p>“O yes!” cried Rosebud, with eagerness; “I
will come instantly!”</p>

<p>“That,” said Bertha, “you cannot do. Listen
now, while I give you instructions. Do you fear
the night?”</p>

<p>“No, pretty Bertha,” said Rosebud. “For me
the night is often more beautiful than the day. I
walked behind my granny, last night, a long way
in the moonlight, and was not afraid.”</p>

<p>And Rosebud then related to Bertha what had
happened, and how she had followed the old woman.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see that you have courage!” said Bertha;
“you will not fail me. But why do you say
‘pretty Bertha’? I can see you, little Rosebud, for
there are holes pierced in the rock to let in the
light of day, and through one of these I see your
face, and a charming face it is; but I am hid from
you.”</p>

<p>“But your voice is pretty,” said Rosebud.</p>

<p>“Do you think that?” asked Bertha; “listen,
then, to it, while it instructs you what to do.</p>

<p>“Follow the old woman when she comes at night
to the Wood. Watch when she lifts the stone, then
follow her through the entrance. Mind the stairs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Ten steep stairs. A false step there would throw
you down and spoil everything. Once at the bottom,
keep close behind your old granny,—it is well
for us she is a little deaf,—until she stops at an iron
door. Then look narrowly to see from whence she
takes the heavy brass key. No more can be done
then. Make your way home as quickly as you may,
lest she turn and discover you. Does little Rosebud
understand thus far?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Rosebud, “I am to learn where the
great brass key is kept.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” said Bertha. “Now listen again.
When next the old woman goes to the town, you
must hasten to the Wood, remove the flat stone,
and enter the passage, find your way through, unlock
the iron door,—you will know where the key
is kept,—then keep on still farther until you come
to a second iron door, then call, ‘Bertha!’ and I
will answer. Then, Rosebud, I and my little maid
will be free, and shall fly far from here!”</p>

<p>“But where?” asked Rosebud. “Will you not
be discovered? and will not your bad uncle punish
you?”</p>

<p>“Never fear that!” cried Bertha. “Are there
no boats? We can manage an oar.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘Softly, softly dips the oar,</div>
<div class="verse">Farther, farther from the shore</div>
<div class="indent">We go, we go, we cheerily go!</div>
<div class="verse">O the sea, the rippling sea!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span></div>
<div class="verse">The bright, the glancing waves for me!</div>
<div class="indent">Go build me a boat</div>
<div class="indent">All lightly to float,</div>
<div class="verse">And away o’er the waters so free</div>
<div class="indent">We’ll row, we’ll row, we’ll cheerily row!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Yes, little Rosebud, a boat! Are there no
boats upon the shore?”</p>

<p>“Many boats,” said Rosebud. “O, very many
boats!”</p>

<p>“All will then be well,” said Bertha. “My
father taught me to row, and to ride, and to hunt,
and to aim the bow. We shall reach our native
home, for with gold can be bought a trusty guide.
All will go well. And now, sweet Rosebud,
farewell. Be cautious, but at the same time be
brave. Tell no one what has happened to-day.
Adieu!”</p>

<p>Rosebud promised most faithfully, then bade adieu
to Bertha, and ran hastily along the first path which
offered; but soon found herself again bewildered
among thickets of tangled vines and thorny bushes,
through which no way seemed to open.</p>

<p>Still it was a pleasant spot. Flowering shrubs
were growing there, and berries in plenty. A little
brook fell over some rocks near by, and Rosebud
stooped to drink of its waters. Squirrels ran nimbly
up the trees, peeping out with their bright eyes
from among the leaves. While watching these, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
they hopped so nimbly from bough to bough, she
perceived, sitting upon the lower branch of a tree,
a fine-feathered bird, seemingly so tame that she
stepped nearer to examine its bright wings. But
on her approach it flew slowly to the next tree;
and then, as Rosebud followed, it again flew, and
alighted on a tall bush, a little farther on.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i096.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>“Bird, I must have you!” cried Rosebud; “and
Myrtle must make for you a cage, a painted cage!
O you pretty bird! You fine-feathered bird!
Ah, you stop! You are not afraid! Come,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
now!” And she reached forward, hand extended,
to grasp it.</p>

<p>But the bird still flew a little farther, and a little
farther, now in this direction, now in that, and she
was upon the point of giving it up altogether, when
it began to sing so charmingly!</p>

<p>“O, now I cannot leave you!” she cried. And
so kept on and on, until she felt at last that the
power of turning away from it was gone, and that,
wherever the bird led, there must she follow.</p>

<p>A long while he flew, and most charmingly he
sang the while. But Rosebud grew very weary,
and was about to sink down upon the grass in despair
of ever again finding her way home, when,
looking around her, she found herself quite near
the spot where she had entered the Wood in the
morning.</p>

<p>“And now, fair bird, won’t you go home with
me?” she cried; but the fine-feathered bird had
flown.</p>

<p>Rosebud then searched out the mossy gray rock
and the flat stone, which she found herself quite
able to move.</p>

<p>But it was now long past noon.</p>

<p>“I must wait no longer,” she said, “for Bess and
Judy and Myrtle will be wondering what has befallen
me.”</p>

<p>Arrived home, she was greeted with joy by Myrtle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
and with endless questions from all. To which
her only answer was, that she had found berries in
plenty, also lovely flowers, and had seen a fine-feathered
bird which sang sweetly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>MEETING AND PARTING.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next night Rosebud lay awake, anxiously
waiting for the hour when granny should go
forth with her lantern. Her heart beat quickly at
the thought of what must that night be done, of all
that Bertha expected from her, and she only a little
girl, only Rosebud.</p>

<p>But courage was by no means wanting. And,
besides, she was very curious to see the sweet singer,—the
pleasant-voiced maiden, who, she felt sure,
must be wondrously beautiful.</p>

<p>At length footsteps were heard in the next room,
the outer door closed, and Rosebud could see from
her window the old woman hobbling away to the
Wood. She followed, well wrapped in her cloak.
Everything was the same as before,—the dew upon
the grass, the stillness, the brightness, all the same.
Having reached the Wood, Rosebud watched very
closely where the old woman disappeared, and entered,
behind her, the opening of which Bertha had
spoken. She remembered the ten stone stairs, counted
them one by one, and reached the bottom in safety.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Granny was making her way along the passage; at
length she paused, and set down the lantern. Stooping
over, she removed a stone from the wall near the
ground; from behind this stone she drew out a heavy
brass key, with which she proceeded to open the iron
door.</p>

<p>Rosebud felt a strong desire to follow still farther,
and, if possible, get just one glimpse of the mysterious
singer and her little maid, but deemed it wiser to follow
Bertha’s directions and return home at once.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not many days after, granny, one fine morning,
took her staff and her bundle, and started for the
town. “Now,” thought Rosebud, “now, if ever,
must I fulfil my promise.”</p>

<p>And when Myrtle had gone off for a day’s fishing,
as granny now often compelled him to do; and when
she had piled up her drift-wood, and scrubbed the
platters, and sanded the floor, and looked at her
plants, and driven the geese to water,—she hastened
away over hills and valleys to the Wood, as
she had often done before.</p>

<p>The flat stone was soon found, and, after some
exertion, removed. Carefully descending the ten
steep stairs, she found herself in a narrow passage
below. If she had but thought of the lantern! But
it was now too late for that.</p>

<p>With both hands extended, she groped along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
passage to the iron door. Here, stooping down, she
soon found the loose stone. The heavy brass key
was drawn forth, and applied to the lock. But, although
it turned freely, the door would not open.
What was now to be done? There was no time to
lose. Suppose some chance traveller were to find
the entrance? or suppose granny herself should
happen that way?</p>

<p>Again she grasped the key, again it turned in the
lock, and again the door would not open.</p>

<p>“Bertha! Bertha!” she called. But Bertha
could not hear.</p>

<p>When almost ready to give up in despair, she
heard, not far off, a sound like the warbling of a bird,
and could very clearly distinguish these words:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Courage, maiden, never fear,</div>
<div class="verse">All is well, no danger near;</div>
<div class="verse">To the left now turn the key,</div>
<div class="verse">Three times three, three times three.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>With new courage Rosebud began turning the
key to the left, and at the ninth turning the door
swung slowly open.</p>

<p>But there was yet a long way to travel. A long,
long way it seemed to Rosebud. But she thought
of her promise to the sorrowful maiden, and kept
bravely on.</p>

<p>Presently she heard voices singing, and knew
then that the end of the long passage was near.
She called aloud, “Bertha! Bertha!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Is it you? Is it Rosebud?” cried a voice.
“Hasten, there is yet another iron door.”</p>

<p>“But how shall I enter?” called out Rosebud.</p>

<p>“Feel for the bolt. You can easily slip the bolt,”
said Bertha.</p>

<p>The bolt yielded readily, the door flew open, and
Rosebud felt herself embraced with kisses and with
tears of joy.</p>

<p>For all the dim light, Rosebud could easily perceive
how beautiful was her new friend. And she
stood gazing, like one entranced, at her dark, flashing
eyes, her black, braided hair, and her rosy red
cheeks. Upon her head was a small velvet cap of
scarlet, and the facings of her dark velvet jacket
were of the same color. She was but little taller
than Rosebud, but was straight and well formed,
and the long, dark braids of hair hung below her
waist. A small plume, fastened to the little cap by
a cluster of jewels, drooped gracefully at one side.
Her face wore a merry look in spite of her troubles,
and when she smiled—O, Rosebud thought nothing
could be more beautiful than her smile!</p>

<p>“This is my dear little maid,” said she,—“my
faithful, loving little maid, who will never desert me.”</p>

<p>The little maid now came forward, and was, so
Rosebud thought, almost as charming as her mistress.
She was certainly as ready to escape, and in
any way Bertha might choose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>It was arranged that Rosebud should leave them,
and return to the hut, lest some one should come
out in search of her. Late in the afternoon Bertha
and her little maid would venture forth, taking care
to lock the door behind them, and leave the great
brass key in its place. They would remain concealed
in the wood until evening, and would then
proceed with all haste to the shore, where Rosebud
promised to meet them and guide them to a boat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night there was no sleep for Rosebud. The
moment that granny left the hut with her lantern,
she arose and stepped out softly upon the sands.
The stars were out, but the moon had not yet risen,—which,
for those who wished to remain hid, was all
the better. Rosebud walked timidly down to the
water’s edge, her little heart beating quickly, for
she knew that Bertha and her little maid were then
on their way to the shore. She sat down upon the
rocks to wait. The time seemed long. Had harm
befallen them? Perhaps they were lost in the
woods, or had met with robbers, or granny had found
them.</p>

<p>But as Rosebud sat there upon the rocks, listening
to the dash of the waves, fearing she knew not
what, though hoping all would be well, she heard
footsteps near, and at the same moment a low,
sweet voice singing,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent1">“Go build me a boat,</div>
<div class="indent">All lightly to float</div>
<div class="verse">And away o’er the waters so free</div>
<div class="indent">We’ll row, we’ll row,</div>
<div class="indent">We’ll cheerily row.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Rosebud sprang to meet them.</p>

<p>“Safe?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Safe!” cried Bertha. “Where is the boat?”</p>

<p>“This way,” said Rosebud; “come with me.”</p>

<p>Bertha threw her arm about Rosebud, and, as
they thus walked along upon the sands, listening to
the rush of the night breeze through the tall beach-grass,
and to the never-ending song of the sea, the
stars twinkling down upon them all the while, she
put to her many questions. Was granny really her
grandmother? How long had they lived there?
Who were her parents? Where were they? Why
was she not with them?</p>

<p>And Rosebud told Bertha her whole history,—weeping
as she spoke of her father and mother, and
told how they had loved her. And Bertha wept
too, and begged that Rosebud would go with her,
and be her own dear sister.</p>

<p>But no, Rosebud said, when Rupert came, she
might, perhaps, obtain from him some tidings of her
parents. She must wait for Rupert. But if, after
long waiting, Rupert came not, then she and Myrtle
together would seek in distant lands to learn their
fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>Then Bertha promised that her father should send
a great army to take the wicked Magnus, and to
rescue the good King Brondé and his Lily Queen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the boat they selected were lines, hooks, leads,
and a heavy sea-coat. These were left upon the
rocks, and in the pocket of the heavy sea-coat Bertha
placed two rings containing jewels of value, that
the owner of the boat might suffer no loss.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i105.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Bertha then embraced Rosebud, kissing her many
times. “My dear Rosebud,” said she, “your sweet
face draws my whole heart to you. I grieve that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
we must now part, and you be left here so sad and
lonely. May my dearest hopes perish if I do not
yet render you good service! But see! the moon
is rising. One more kiss! Farewell!”</p>

<p>They launched their boat, and, stepping in, pushed
boldly off from shore. The rising moon threw its
beams across the sea. Each little wave danced and
sparkled in the light.</p>

<p>Farther, farther away sped the boat; and Rosebud,
listening to the dash of the oars, could faintly distinguish
the words of Bertha’s farewell, which was
a reply to Rosebud’s question, whether they were
not afraid to sail away thus alone.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent12">“O, not alone.</div>
<div class="verse">The moon shall guide me o’er the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">The little stars are friends to me;</div>
<div class="verse">And the dancing waves, so light and free,</div>
<div class="verse">O, they shall bear me company!</div>
<div class="indent">Farewell, now fare thee well!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Fainter and fainter grew the music. The boat
was now but a speck upon the waters.</p>

<p>And thus did Bertha and her little maiden float
away in the moonlight out upon the wide sea!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>THE CHILDREN IN TROUBLE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the little boat could no longer be seen,
Rosebud went sorrowfully back to the hut
and to her bed. And there she lay, trembling, expecting
every moment the return of the old woman.
But day dawned; the sun rose, the children also; and
still she had not appeared.</p>

<p>What had become of granny?</p>

<p>Rosebud and Myrtle permitted themselves to linger
long about the flower-garden. Many of the
plants had budded, a few had bloomed. Rosebud
bent over them, touching tenderly their soft green
leaves, and persuading them, so Myrtle affirmed, to
grow faster, and even, as he further declared, whispering
to them of what pretty color they should tint
their blossoms!</p>

<p>The children of the shore, with their baskets, had
gathered around to talk with Rosebud, to wonder
at the growth of the plants, and to admire all they
saw. Every child must examine every flower that
had bloomed, marvel at its beauty, and all were
longing for the next buds to open.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>While they were thus assembled, talking earnestly,
granny suddenly appeared among them.</p>

<p>Her dress was torn, the blue blanket had fallen
from her head, the gray locks streamed about her
withered face, and her eyes glared fiercely. The
children with looks of affright shrank from the old
woman. Coming near them, she shook her fist
angrily at Rosebud.</p>

<p>“And is it thus you work when I am away?”
she cried. “I’ll teach you!”</p>

<p>And with that she hobbled in among the flowers,
and began beating them with her staff, pulling them
up, and throwing them far and wide. In a few moments
the pretty garden was destroyed!</p>

<p>Poor Rosebud! she had loved them so! It
seemed as if those were parts of herself which were
thus cruelly tossed upon the sands. So much had
she lived with them, caressed them, talked to them,
that they were to her almost like living beings.</p>

<p>But not a word did she say, neither did one of the
rest dare speak to the old woman in her fury.</p>

<p>“Be off! Be off now! the whole pack of you!
Take your baskets and be gone, I say!” she cried,
stamping her foot with rage.</p>

<p>Mournfully the little group moved toward the
shore, Myrtle and Rosebud among them. For they
dared not stay, even to witness the death of their
flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>When they returned at noon, granny was again
absent. But there lay the flowers, their tender
green leaves, with a few bright blossoms, drooping,
scorching, dying in the noonday sun.</p>

<p>Rosebud bent over them, hoping some might be
found which, if replanted, would yet live. But no,
the scorching heat had done its work.</p>

<p>Sorrowfully then they gathered up the remains
of the dear plants which had given them so much
delight, and buried them, with some tears, in the
same spot they had blessed with their short-lived
beauty,—the spot now saddened by their cruel
death.</p>

<p>Even their fear of the angry old woman could not
prevent the children of the shore from gathering
there when they knew what Myrtle and Rosebud
were doing; and they looked so mournful when
the flowers one after another were covered with the
dark earth!</p>

<p>“The funeral of the flowers!” said one little
child, sadly, as she smoothed the surface with her
hand.</p>

<p>This same little child, during the afternoon,
begged of a countryman seeds of pretty grasses,
which were strewn thickly over the spot.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even Bess and Judy were sorry for Rosebud.
For as the sun warms the hard rock, and melts the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
cold ice, so had the sunshine of Rosebud’s sweet face
warmed and melted their hearts. If you rudely
strike a little bird, it will but droop its head; and,
if you crush a flower, it will but wither and fade.
So when these two girls gave to Rosebud spiteful
words, or even blows, she did but droop her head
and look sorrowful. For the love-flame had never
yet grown dim in her heart. It burned clear and
bright, purifying her whole nature.</p>

<p>And thus it came about that Bess and Judy were
at last melted to kindness. They had long ceased
to give spiteful words to one who never returned
them, and would now as soon have thought of striking
a bird or a flower as this loving, gentle child
who had come among them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i110.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>And in this time of her trouble they were even
willing to do something to comfort her. At twilight,
just after the seeds were sown over the grave of the
flowers, they came, bringing two little feeble plants,
which they had found in a moist spot, under the
shelter of a rock. The damp earth still clung to
their roots. These were replanted in a hidden corner,
and watered daily. One died. The other
lived and grew and blossomed. And its flower was
a delicate white lily.</p>

<p>Myrtle, one morning, found Rosebud bending
sadly over this flower, scarcely raising her eyes at
his approach.</p>

<p>“I think it must,” said she, at last, looking up,
and smiling through her tears.</p>

<p>“Must what?” asked Myrtle.</p>

<p>“Must mean,” said Rosebud, “that she is yet
alive.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Great was the surprise of the old woman at finding
the cage empty, her bird flown. The bolt was
secured, the iron door locked, the key safe, nothing
out of the way except—the prisoners.</p>

<p>Thinking they must be concealed near, she
looked in the woods about, beat the bushes, got
tangled in the thicket, scratched by the briers, tore
her garments, but did not give up the search until
long after sunrise in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>It was from this vain search, that, weary, angry,
and much alarmed for her own safety, she arrived
home to find the children gathered about the flower-garden,
as has been told.</p>

<p>And there was very good reason to be alarmed;
for the Governor of the land, as soon as he knew
of Bertha’s escape, sent his officers, bidding them to
seize the old woman, and to throw her into that very
same rocky cage. The children were in dismay at
seeing granny carried off in such a manner. None
could guess the reason except Rosebud; and she
told only Myrtle. It was one pleasant day, when
they were off sailing, that she related to him the
whole history.</p>

<p>They often went sailing in the little boat, that
they might talk together of Rosebud’s parents, and
the palace, and Rupert. Myrtle said that Rupert’s
coming should no longer be looked for, and that, if
Rosebud’s father was a king, why, then, she was a
princess. Did any one ever hear of a princess picking
up drift-wood, or going barefoot, or living in a
hut? It was quite time they set forth upon their
travels in search of her home. Couldn’t she tell in
what direction to go? or how far? or anything at
all about it?</p>

<p>No, Rosebud only knew that they travelled fast,
and for many, many days, and not always in one
direction; for one very bright star which she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
came to know, and to watch for, on the journey,
shone some nights on her right, and at others on her
left.</p>

<p>But however that might be, she said, they must
go. “Yes,” said Myrtle, “that certainly is quite
plain. And we will go as little pedlers, selling our
shell-work; or perhaps as little singers, singing our
songs. And at every great town we will ask,
‘Who is the king of this country?’ ‘Can you
tell us any news of the Good King Brondé?’ We
will begin at once to collect the shells. And as we
journey along we shall rest often in the shade of the
trees, by the wayside, or on some flowery bank, and
there make our shell-work.”</p>

<p>Thus all was well arranged.</p>

<p>But before they were quite ready to begin this
pleasant journey, something very unexpected happened
to Rosebud; very unexpected, but very good.
Indeed, had she been allowed her choice of all the
delightful things that might happen, she could have
chosen nothing more delightful than this.</p>

<p>But now, while Myrtle and Rosebud are so busy
with their shells and with their wise plans, it will,
perhaps, be well to inquire concerning the Good
King Brondé and his Lily Queen, and whether they
reached home in safety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<small>THE WHITE LAMB.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KING BRONDÉ and his court reached the end
of their homeward journey in safety.</p>

<p>They arrived safely, but to find their palace in
disorder, its beauty spoiled, its treasures stolen, its
walks, gardens, statues, fountains destroyed.</p>

<p>The good king and queen, however, thought only
of Rosebud. Their well-beloved child,—was she
living? And, if yet alive, into whose hands had she
fallen? Messengers were sent far and near
throughout the kingdom. Large rewards were offered,
but all in vain. And at the approach of winter
they gladly removed to their city palace, away
from all which so sadly reminded them of that
unhappy day on which she was taken from them.</p>

<p>Now, although it would seem that every possible
means had been tried, and though many weary
months had passed, yet the Lily Queen still hoped
that her dear child might be restored to her. And,
during the winter every seer, fortune-teller, witch,
or wizard who dwelt in the city, or who wandered
that way, had been consulted. But all had failed to
give true directions for discovering the lost one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Thus, mid hopes and fears, the winter and spring
passed wearily by.</p>

<p>As summer came on, the queen walked much by
herself in the gardens of the palace, that she might,
undisturbed, mourn for her lost darling. Sleepless
nights and much weeping had made her a Pale Lady
indeed. Her strength was failing, her step feeble.
Still, however, she continued her daily walks.</p>

<p>And one day, while wandering in the Orange-Grove,
she saw, in the path before her, a white
lamb.</p>

<p>“Pretty creature!” she cried, “you are pure
and innocent as my own lost lamb!”</p>

<p>And she followed it to the end of the walk, and
so beyond the palace walls, into a cedar-grove.</p>

<p>Here, close by a ruined hovel, which some poor
fagot-gatherer had deserted, the lamb disappeared.
He seemed to have entered the hovel. But, upon
stepping inside the door, she saw only an aged
woman, dressed in dark, flowing robes, who scarcely
raised her eyes from the ground.</p>

<p>“I seek,” said the queen, “a white lamb.”</p>

<p>“The Pale Lady,” said the aged woman, still
without raising her eyes,—“the Pale Lady seeks,
not a lamb, but a sweet flower. Grief lies heavy at
her heart. Threads of white are among her once
fair locks. Her eye is sunken, her strength gone.
All night her tears flow, and the day brings only
weariness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“No joy, no joy for her;</div>
<div class="indent">Sorrow and tears abound.</div>
<div class="verse">No smile, no smile for her</div>
<div class="indent">Until the lost be found.</div>
<div class="verse">But the Wanderer shall return;</div>
<div class="indent">The lost shall yet be found;</div>
<div class="verse">Then for the sorrowing one</div>
<div class="indent">Shall joy and smiles abound!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The queen sprang forward, her hands clasped,
her whole face lighted up with joy.</p>

<p>“Tell me!—tell me where is my child!” she
cried.</p>

<p>The aged woman made no reply. Slowly raising
her head, she gazed long and earnestly in one direction.
It seemed as if her pale, filmy blue eye were
fixed upon some object or objects far, far away.
Her head bent forward, her right arm slowly raised
itself, while the forefinger seemed pointing to something
in the dim distance.</p>

<p>At length she spoke. The words came slowly,
and there was an intent expression upon her face, as
if she were listening to indistinct sounds.</p>

<p>“I hear the distant moaning of the sea. I hear
the dash of waves upon the shore. I see the tall
beach-grass bending in the breeze. Shells lie upon
the sands,—pink, purple, and white. Their gleaming
is beautiful in the sunlight. White-sailed ships go
by. A boat is tossing upon the waves. A noble
boy pulls the oar. Brave and handsome as a young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
prince. How boldly he guides the boat! It touches
the shore. A little girl runs smiling to meet him!
Her fair curls stream in the wind. Her teeth are
like pearls; her eye is like the violet; her cheek
like the rose. Gayly flutter her green robes. The
boy is glad to see the little girl, running to meet
him. He calls out to her, ‘Rosebud! Rosebud!’”</p>

<p>The queen had stood, bending forward, her eyes
fastened upon the withered face before her, hardly
daring to breathe, lest some precious word be lost.
Her excitement grew every moment more intense,
and when the last word, “Rosebud!” was spoken,
she uttered a cry of joy, and sank, half fainting, to
the ground.</p>

<p>Upon recovering, the Lily Queen found herself
alone in the hovel. No dark-robed old woman or
pretty white lamb was to be seen. Neither could
it be told how long she had lain there.</p>

<p>But she felt sure that, during the time, a form
had bent over her, and spoken these words:—</p>

<p>“Travel towards the setting sun, as far as the
shores of Silver Lake. From this lake flows a
stream. Follow this stream to the sea.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>A LONG JOURNEY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">KING BRONDÉ had been so often disappointed,
that he was, at first, unwilling to set forth
upon so very doubtful a journey; and especially as
no person could be found who could tell in what
direction lay this unknown Silver Lake.</p>

<p>In order, however, to divert the mind of the
queen, he laid aside his doubts, and commanded
that preparations for travelling be made at once.</p>

<p>The grand state coach, all covered with gold and
silver, and drawn by twenty white horses, was got
in readiness, and also other magnificent coaches; for
many lords and nobles of the court were to go in
attendance, and also a band of soldiers.</p>

<p>On they travelled, for days and weeks. Many
gave up all hope, and spoke of returning. Beautiful
lakes had they passed, but thus far not one bearing
the name Silver Lake had been found. And the
king said one day:—</p>

<p>“My dear Lily Queen, this Silver Lake, with
its stream flowing to the sea,—was it not all a
dream? Shall we chase a vision? Let us return,
and no longer cherish vain hopes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>The queen, however, would not be persuaded.
A little farther, she said, and yet a little farther;
but at last agreed, that if, by the morrow’s sunset,
no Silver Lake was found, they would then return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The morrow was past. Bravely had they travelled
on, and, just as the sun went down, were ready
to halt in a poor little village.</p>

<p>The sky was all aglow with the brilliant hues of
sunset. In the west lay clouds of purple and gold,
and of all radiant colors. The Lily Queen gazed
mournfully at this fine show. For the morrow was
now past, the sunset hour had come, and she could
no longer ask to continue the journey. This last
hope, then, was gone.</p>

<p>But while her gaze was fixed upon a broad, high
hill, which stood darkly up against the western sky,
she perceived, advancing steadily over it, a long procession
or company of people. Perhaps, thought she,
a troop of hostile soldiers, or perhaps some robber
band to waylay us. She distinctly saw plumes
waving, also banners streaming, and heard the
sound of music.</p>

<p>She hastened to the king. He and his attendants
were already alarmed, and were watching, with
some anxiety, the oncoming of this host. The soldiers,
well armed, stood ready to receive them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>Nearer and nearer they come. Now down the
sides of the hill; now along the plain; and now they
enter the streets of the village. Troops of horsemen
ride in advance. In the midst of these is a grand
chariot, decked out with costly trappings.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i120.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Inside this chariot sits a royally dressed person,
who has a noble countenance, and who wears a
crown. By his side is a sprightly young maiden,
with sparkling black eyes and a merry face. Upon
her head is a red velvet cap and plume, from beneath
which hang long braids of shining hair. She also
wears a velvet jacket, with scarlet facings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>This bright-eyed maiden is Bertha. She has
persuaded her father to make inquiries concerning
the good King Brondé, and they are now on their
way to his kingdom with trains of armed attendants.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Who can describe the raptures of the Lily Queen
as she held in her arms one who had, not so very
long before, embraced her darling child?—one who
could relate all that happened to her after the day
when they were parted. Then came endless questions.</p>

<p>Where was Rosebud now? Was she well? Was
she sorrowful? Was she in distress? And, above
all, could Bertha guide them to her?</p>

<p>No. Not directly. Bertha was ignorant of both
the name and the situation of that little village by
the shore.</p>

<p>Did she know of Silver Lake?</p>

<p>O yes! Certainly, she knew of Silver Lake.</p>

<p>“Come,” said she, “to the top of yonder hill,
which looms so darkly against the sunset brightness.”</p>

<p>All therefore proceeded to the top of this broad
hill, and there, far below, they beheld a sheet of
water, so smooth, so silvery, and so fair, that it
seemed a round piece of silver, just dropped from
the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“But where is the stream which flows to the
sea?” asked the king.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stream which flowed to the sea was, at first,
only a little brook. It ran out from the lake, beneath
mosses and bending grass; hid itself, for a
long way, among thick, overhanging bushes, but at
length came dancing out into the sunshine, and went
its way through meadow and wood singing its own
happy song.</p>

<p>And soon it was joined by other little singing
brooks, all going the same way. Thus it happened
that, after travelling many miles, the small stream
became a river, and flowed to the sea.</p>

<p>But by no means in a direct course, or always by
pleasant ways. It ran here and there, doubling,
curving, winding, now through tangled forests, now
sweeping around the base of a mountain, now leaping
a precipice or dashing itself against the ragged
rocks, thus leading our travellers a tiresome and
oftentimes a dangerous journey; for there were
mountains to climb, roads to cut through the forest,
and frequently a hasty bridge to be thrown across a
stream.</p>

<p>And one night while resting in a small village
they narrowly escaped a great danger; for, without
the assistance of the king,—Bertha’s father,—they
must have all been taken prisoners. This danger
was from Magnus, King Brondé’s old enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Having, by means of his great strength, escaped
from prison, he had again rallied around him a powerful
band. He then sent out spies, and, having
learned from them of King Brondé’s journey, he
resolved to surprise and attack him by night. It
was Bertha who discovered their approach. She
was sitting late at the window, looking at the moon
and the hurrying clouds, and thinking of her true
love away at the wars, when her eye caught from
afar the gleaming of steel in the moonlight, and she
presently saw armed men winding around the foot
of a hill. She quickly gave the alarm, and all placed
themselves in readiness for whatever might come.</p>

<p>Now Magnus had supposed that Brondé’s party
would be easily taken. Intending a surprise, he
was himself surprised at being so far outnumbered,
and fled in dismay, with all his band.</p>

<p>But a shower of sharp-pointed arrows was sent in
among them. Many of his men were seen to fall;
and Magnus himself received wounds, of which a
few years after he died.</p>

<p>And now, dreading another attack, a watch was
set every night. They were not, however, again
molested. All went well with them. Full of hope,
they kept bravely on, and at length arrived, one
beautiful morning, at the top of a high hill, from
whence could be heard the distant moaning of the
sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Bertha begged the Queen to calm herself, and to
remember that even if they found the little fishing-hamlet,
it was by no means sure that Rosebud would
still be living there. Rupert might have come for
her, or else she and Myrtle might have begun their
travels in search of her home, as they had planned.</p>

<p>The queen only answered by a sign to go on
faster, faster!</p>

<p>On arriving at the summit of the next hill, the
sea, the broad blue sea, lay spread before them. Its
waves came dashing upon the sandy shores below.</p>

<p>They saw the white-sailed ships go by, and the
little boats tossing upon the waters, near the shore.
One is guided by a boy. There are children sitting
on the rocks. A little girl runs down to the water’s
edge.</p>

<p>King Brondé and the queen dared no longer
look. Unable to speak or hardly to breathe, they
sank back among the cushions, and there awaited in
silence what might be the fulfilment, or might be
the destruction, of their hopes.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV.<br />

<small>TEARS AND SMILES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW it happened that on this very day Myrtle
and Rosebud had planned a visit to the town.
Myrtle said they would first try their luck there, as
little pedlers, before venturing farther. He would
rise before daybreak and go out with the boat, and
if he made a good catch, they would take, besides
the shell-work, fresh fish, to sell by the way. Long
before the girls were stirring, therefore, he was far
out upon the waters.</p>

<p>Bess and Judy were full of wonder at the courage
of Rosebud, in daring to venture upon so long a
journey. Never in their lives had they seen the
town. They were, however, quite ready to help;
prepared the breakfast, tidied the hut, drove the
geese to water, and assisted in packing the shell-baskets.</p>

<p>When all was in readiness, the three went out to
sit upon the rocks and there await the coming of
Myrtle. The children of the shore, with their baskets,
gathered around them; for all had heard of
the coming journey to the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Presently the boat appeared in sight. On it came,
bounding over the waves, and rapidly approached
the shore. All the children stood still, watching the
little boat, and admiring the skill with which Myrtle
directed its course.</p>

<p>All but Rosebud. She, as was her custom, ran
down to meet him at the water’s edge, her fair curls
streaming, her green robes fluttering in the wind.
She laughed aloud and clapped her hands, while
waiting for Myrtle to call to her from the boat.</p>

<p>“Rosebud! Rosebud!” he cried, at last, as the
boat touched the shore, “such a catch of fish! we
will take some to the town, and spread some to dry
on the rocks, and some we will—”</p>

<p>But here he was interrupted by loud cries from
the children, who came running to them, calling out,
that there were, O so many horses, and soldiers, and
coaches larger than their hut, all covered with gold
and silver, and great lords in purple and scarlet with
gay feathers and jewels, all sparkling and shining!
Rosebud and Myrtle must run quick! Quick!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But there was no need to run far, for all these
wonders were speedily drawing near. A few moments,
and soldiers, chariots, and horses covered the
sands.</p>

<p>The great state coach of King Brondé was in
advance of all the rest. Its door flew open, and
Rosebud, with a cry of joy, sprang forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>Rosebud, the lonely wanderer, Rosebud, the long-lost
child, was in the arms of her mother!</p>

<p>Then from the great company assembled there
arose a shout both long and loud, which made the
heavens ring. And in the midst of all could be
heard and seen Bertha, clapping her hands and
dancing for joy.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the happy family within
the coach could do more than to embrace one another,
and to weep tears of happiness. But at length
King Brondé desired to be conducted to the hut,
which had for so long been the home of his child.</p>

<p>A portion of the doorway was hewn down, and
into that humble dwelling King Brondé entered, and
there sat down with the Lily Queen and with Rosebud,
while all the children of the shore stood outside
lost in wonder, answering, as best they might, the
various questions put to them by the lords and nobles.</p>

<p>King Brondé, having learned the character of the
old woman, ordered the hut to be searched, and in
the cellar were found concealed many costly jewels.
These he commanded should be carefully packed and
taken to his palace, and there kept until the old
woman could be brought and made to tell who were
their rightful owners.</p>

<p>This being settled, King Brondé and his queen
were eager to set out for their own kingdom. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Rosebud would first bid farewell to the children of
the shore; and also to Bess and Judy, who were
weeping bitterly. What could they do without
Rosebud? She had been so gentle with them, and
so kind. Must they lose that sunny smile? The
hut would be dark and lonely now!</p>

<p>The other children were standing sorrowfully by;
and when Rosebud would have bidden them farewell,
they with one accord burst into tears.</p>

<p>Poor Rosebud, she must needs weep too! For
they had loved her, and she had loved them, every
one.</p>

<p>But where was Myrtle? Had any one seen Myrtle?
All began to look about and to inquire. But
no one had seen him, since he first leaped ashore
with his basket of fish.</p>

<p>At length one little girl whispered to Rosebud,
pointing at the same time to a clump of bushes at
a little distance.</p>

<p>And there she found him, lying upon the ground,
crying as if his very heart would break.</p>

<p>Rosebud begged him not to cry, but to arise, come
to the hut, and see her father and mother,—her
father and mother, of whom they had so often
talked. They need not be little pedlers, now.</p>

<p>But he would not be persuaded, and Rosebud returned
sorrowfully to the hut.</p>

<p>“But who is this Myrtle?” asked King Brondé.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>Then Rosebud told how good Myrtle was, and
how they had played together, and sailed together,
and of their plans, and of all his kindness to her
ever since she came to the shore.</p>

<p>“And why not take Myrtle?” asked the Lily
Queen; “surely our coach is big enough to hold
him, and surely our palace is big enough to receive
him, and surely our hearts are big enough to love
one who has been so good to our Rosebud!”</p>

<p>“Very true!” cried King Brondé.</p>

<p>Rosebud flew once more to the clump of bushes.
“Myrtle! Myrtle!” she cried, “you are to go
with us! to go! to go! to go! In my father’s
coach! And live in my father’s palace! Myrtle!
do you hear?”</p>

<p>No wonder she asked, “Do you hear?” For the
poor boy was so overwhelmed, first by his grief,
and then by his joy, that he seemed to have lost all
power of speech and motion.</p>

<p>But Rosebud urged him to rise, and then led him
to the same spot where she had once advised him to
wash his face in the spring. And here she bade
him bathe his swollen eyes, and smooth his hair,
that the king and queen might see what a handsome
Myrtle he was.</p>

<p>But alas! so red was his face and so inflamed
by weeping, that she was obliged to tell them this
herself. And they were quite ready to believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>King Brondé now gave Rosebud money to distribute
among her late companions, and there was
not one who did not get a bright gold piece, or who
did not preserve it carefully as a remembrance of
one they had loved so well. Bess and Judy, at
Rosebud’s request, were given in charge to some of
the attendants, that they might also be taken home,
and provided for in a comfortable manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All now being ready, the joyful party entered the
coach. Drums beat, bugles played, the twenty
white horses arched their proud necks and stepped
gayly off to the sound of the music. And side by
side with the great state coach came another royal
chariot, wherein sat Bertha, smiling-faced Bertha,
with her father the king. Behind followed all their
lords, nobles, attendants, and bands of soldiers,—a
numerous train.</p>

<p>The children of the shore stood watching till the
last plume of the last soldier disappeared, then
turned sorrowfully toward their homes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Who can speak of the happiness of that homeward
journey? When the Lily Queen could spare Rosebud
from her own embrace, King Brondé would sit
for hours with her clasped in his arms, looking down
into her face, and stroking her hair softly and tenderly,
as if each touch conveyed a blessing. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
as for Myrtle, so great was his joy, that he scarcely
knew whether he were waking or dreaming. So he
rolled himself up in one corner of the coach, gazing
at the pale Lily Queen, and the big handsome King
Brondé in his royal robes and his golden crown, and
wondered how long they would let the poor little
fisher-boy stay in their palace.</p>

<p>Thus this great company journeyed home. As
soon as the towers of the city came in sight, King
Brondé ordered a bright flag to be raised, for this
was the signal agreed upon in case the search should
prove successful. As they drew nearer, troops of
mounted soldiers came out to meet them; also
bands of music and a great multitude of lords and
ladies of the court, in their fine gilded coaches, all
in grand array. Also one hundred young nobles,
in shining steel armor, and all mounted upon jet
black horses, whose trappings were of pure gold.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Like a triumphal procession they entered the city,
bugles playing, trumpets sounding, drums beating,
banners streaming, horses prancing, plumes waving,
and were met by the people with wild huzzas. And
years and years after, mothers related to their children
the story of the wonderful day when good
King Brondé brought home his lost child.</p>

<small>A DISCOVERY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">YEARS passed by, and happy years they were.
Rosebud, as she grew older, was the same
sweet-voiced, kindly maiden, winning love from all.
People gazing at her beaming face asked themselves
often what it was that so charmed them there. This
which they could not name was the love-light, which
shone through her eyes and lighted up her countenance;
for the holy fire burned always in her heart,
making her whole life pure and bright. The idol of
the court, praised, petted, flattered, still was she not
spoiled. Ah, Rosebud was far too modest, too humble
for that. Real love not only brightens, but
purifies, keeping away all evil.</p>

<p>As King Brondé had no son, he adopted Myrtle
for his own. He provided for him the best instructors,
and treated him in all things as if he
were really his child.</p>

<p>And the youth grew up, stately and handsome as
a young prince. He mingled freely with the young
nobles of the court, and, by his gentle bearing and
his true manliness, became a favorite with every
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Bess and Judy were established in a handsome
house of their own, and every day had cause to
bless the good King Brondé and his Lily Queen.</p>

<p>Thus, as was before observed, the years flew happily
on. But when years fly on, though never so
happily, they carry us along with them. And the
happy years that were flying on at the palace were
taking King Brondé and his queen towards old age,
were taking Myrtle out of his childhood, and changing
our Rosebud to a full-blown rose.</p>

<p>And when Myrtle was no longer a child, he began
to think. And when he began to think, he thought
how wonderful it was that he should have thus been
brought from a hut to a palace, changed from a
fisher-boy to the son of a king.</p>

<p>And he thought, also, that he should like to be
still more a son to him, and to marry Rosebud for
his wife, if King Brondé were willing, but was
afraid to ask. For were there not plenty of young
lords, and also real princes, who came to visit the
court? King Brondé might prefer one of these.
Rosebud herself might. He was not sure, after all,
that he would not rather they two were still living
at the hut, for when they were children of the shore
she liked him better than any. But these, he felt,
were selfish thoughts, and must never come again.</p>

<p>Still, if selfish thoughts might be kept away, serious,
anxious thoughts could not; and these came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
often to cloud his face, and to make Rosebud wonder
why Myrtle appeared so thoughtful, so troubled.</p>

<p>Now it happened, one lovely afternoon, when the
king and his court were at the summer palace, near
Long Forest, that Myrtle was walking in the gardens
with Rosebud. These same anxious thoughts
were present in his mind. They clouded his face,
and gave to his voice a sorrowful tone.</p>

<p>“Where are your thoughts?” asked Rosebud,
“and why are you so troubled?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you,” said Myrtle, after a few moments
of silence,—“I will tell you, first, where are
my thoughts, and next, why I am so troubled. My
thoughts are far away at the sea-shore, by a little
spring, where a little girl once declared that the
rose and the myrtle went well together. I fear she
may not think so always. That is why I am so
troubled.”</p>

<p>Rosebud looked down, and walked silently on by
his side, until they came to a rosebush, bearing a
rose, not quite fully blown, which she plucked. A
little farther on they passed the queen’s fine myrtle-arbor.
From this she cut a sprig and intwined it
with the rose. The two, thus joined, she placed in
his hand. He knew then that the little girl still
believed that the rose and the myrtle went well
together.</p>

<p>At a little distance they saw, walking towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
them, the king and his queen. As they met, Myrtle
held out to the king the pretty token he had just
received from Rosebud,—held it out doubtfully, as
if fearing his displeasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i135.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>But the king smiled, remembering, no doubt, the
long ago when he himself had loved a king’s daughter;
and the queen smiled; and Rosebud smiled.
Why, then, should not Myrtle smile, too? And
then the good King Brondé opened wide his arms,
clasped them both to his heart, gave them his blessing,
and wished they might live as happily together
as had he and his beloved Lily Queen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Not long after this came the wedding. And
such a wedding was surely never known before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>The kings of all the countries round about came
with their queens, and their courts, and their mounted
guards, and their bands of music, and their
waving banners. There were illuminations in the
cities, and fires blazed upon the mountain-tops.
Prisoners were released, and gold and silver thrown
by handfuls to the poor. Tables were spread in the
streets, that everybody might feast.</p>

<p>Happy they who could obtain entrance into the
palace. Happier still they who were admitted into
that grand apartment where the marriage rites were
performed. Happiest of all they who obtained a
glimpse of the charming bride.</p>

<p>She wore, at Myrtle’s request, a robe of the very
palest green, which was besprinkled with diamonds.
Upon her fair curls rested a coronet of rosebuds,
every leaf of which was a separate jewel.</p>

<p>But nothing was so lovely, so charming to all, as
her own sweet face, expressing, as might plainly be
seen, the most perfect love and the most perfect
happiness.</p>

<p>All her old friends were present. Bess and Judy
were there, side by side with her own sisters. The
wood-cutter’s children were there, the little boy and
girl whom Rosebud saved from the boat. The
wood-cutter himself was there. For his services on
the day and night of the lion hunt, in Long Forest,
he had been well rewarded, and he now lived on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
fine estate, with gold in plenty, and servants to
command.</p>

<p>Even Rupert was present. For when released
from prison, he sought the old woman’s hut, and
after learning from the fishermen all that had happened,
he went immediately to King Brondé’s
dominions, and obtained employment in the grounds
of the palace, that he might be always near Rosebud.
At her request, he was made head-gardener of her
flower-beds, and brought her every morning a fresh
nosegay; and was welcomed with smiles, which, it
may be remembered, was a part of the nice little
plan he had laid when acting as guide.</p>

<p>Bertha, too, was there, the dark-eyed, bright-faced
Bertha; and charming enough she looked
too, in her bright colors, and her little jewelled cap.
And happy enough, too; for the lover came safely
back from the wars, and that same lover, now her
husband, was by her side, and as happy as herself.</p>

<p>The Green Fairy, too, was there, though no one
knew it, in the form of a fine-feathered bird, perched
high on the top of a marble column. Somebody
else, too, was there, who will shortly speak for herself.</p>

<p>After the marriage ceremony had been performed,
the whole company repaired to the most spacious
hall in the palace, where was served up a sumptuous
banquet. The tables were loaded with dishes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
solid gold, and with crystal ornaments. Sweetmeats,
cordials, and spices of richest fragrance were brought
from the remotest corners of the earth. Players of
musical instruments, hidden from sight, sent forth
their softest, sweetest strains.</p>

<p>Roses were everywhere,—roses and myrtle; in
rich vases upon the table, among the decorations of
the walls, in hanging-baskets, in the hands of marble
statues, festooned from the ceiling, wreathed about
the white columns. Roses and myrtle everywhere.
The air was filled with their fragrance. And everybody
said, how beautiful were the myrtle and the
rose together.</p>

<p>At the close of the banquet, King Brondé observed
that the great king who sat at his left hand
appeared sad and downcast; that, although striving
to be gay with the rest, yet he often turned aside to
wipe away a tear.</p>

<p>“What is your grief?” asked King Brondé;
“what great sorrow dwells in your heart, that will
make itself felt, even at this bridal feast?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you that!” cried a strange voice at
his side.</p>

<p>King Brondé turned and saw, standing quite near
him, a little old woman, holding a staff, and wearing
a blue blanket pinned over her head.</p>

<p>“And who are you?” cried King Brondé. “By
what means gained you entrance here? And what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
should one like you know of the troubles of a great
king?”</p>

<p>“The great king has but one trouble,” she replied,
“and that shall soon be taken away. Listen,
now, and you shall hear a true story.</p>

<p>“Many years ago I lived, with my grandchildren,
in a cabin by a lonely wood. One stormy night a
woman, a coarse-featured woman, came to my door,
bringing a young child, which she had stolen for the
sake of the jewels he wore.</p>

<p>“This woman offered me one half, provided I
would allow them to remain hidden there, until
her strength returned, when she would go on with
her journey.</p>

<p>“I accepted this offer, thinking she would soon be
gone, and that the jewels would make me rich.”</p>

<p>“You thief! wretch!” cried King Brondé.</p>

<p>“True, both true,” answered the old woman;
“but permit me to go on with the story; for not
many days are left me, and I would do one good
act before I die.</p>

<p>“The woman never recovered her strength. She
died there, in my cabin. Before her death she confessed
to me that this stolen child was the son of the
king. She had enticed him from his attendants,
while they were walking with him, in the grounds
belonging to the palace.</p>

<p>“I dared not remain in the country with the child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
for if he were found in my hands it would be certain
death to me. I therefore fled with him and
my two grandchildren into another kingdom, where
I dwelt in a little hut by the sea.</p>

<p>“The boy grew up, fair, and with a true princely
look. I compelled him, until all danger of pursuit
was over, to go meanly clad and dirty, lest his
beauty should attract the notice of some passing
traveller.</p>

<p>“And now, when all are making bridal presents, I
come also with a gift to the bridegroom. I present
to him a father. Great king, you have no longer a
trouble: this is your lost boy.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the rejoicing, the happy weeping, the embracing,
and all the deep excitement caused by the
old woman’s story, had somewhat abated, orders
were given to bring forth the jewels, which were
brought from the hut, that she might declare who
were their rightful owners.</p>

<p>And among these was the king’s signet ring,
which he had heedlessly given his boy to play with
on the morning of the day when he was stolen.
This signet ring the old woman had never dared
offer for sale.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>KING MYRTLE AND QUEEN ROSEBUD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THUS it came about that Myrtle was, after all,
a true prince; and his now happy father, having
passed so many childless years, begged that the
young couple might spend at least one half the time
at his court. This request was cheerfully granted.</p>

<p>And after the death of King Brondé and his Lily
Queen, which was not until they had reached a good
old age, Rosebud gave up her share of the kingdom
to her two sisters, that she might dwell always with
Myrtle in his own country.</p>

<p>Thus the two sisters reigned together. The
eldest, with her beauty and her grace, was an ornament
to the court, and drew together the lively and
the gay; while the second, with her great wisdom,
sat in council with the nobles and managed with
rigor the affairs of state; and their reign was called
ever after “The Reign of the Two Queens.”</p>

<p>The old woman died, soon after telling her story,
at the house of Bess and Judy, and was buried, as
she herself had requested, with the blue blanket
upon her head, and her staff beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>After the father of Myrtle died, he and Rosebud
became king and queen, and reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>Their first act was to purchase from the king of
the country adjoining their own the tract of land
which contained the little fishing-hamlet by the sea;
and there, by the side of the old hut, they reared a
splendid palace. The hut was preserved, standing
exactly as it stood in their childhood; and the little
garden-spot behind—the grave of their short-lived
flowers—was planted with lilies, an affectionate
tribute to the memory of the Lily Queen.</p>

<p>The waters of the spring where Myrtle, with fear
and trembling, once dared to wash his face were
made to gush up through a marble fountain, around
which the rose and the myrtle grew well together.</p>

<p>Their old companions were well cared for; and
they loved their king and queen just as well as when
they were children of the shore with themselves;
for the good queen loved her people, and never
ceased to labor for their happiness. The holy fire
had never grown dim; and Myrtle, the noble-hearted
Myrtle, thought and acted always with his beloved
queen. In all things they went hand in hand
and heart in heart; and dwellers upon the remotest
borders of their kingdom found reason to bless the
reign of King Myrtle and Queen Rose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The story is ended, but there is one thing which
some might care to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>One day, as the king and queen were sitting in
their private chamber, talking of the long ago, the
king said: “My dear Rosebud, why was it that the
Green Fairy, as she must have had the power, did
not find some way of informing your parents where
you were hidden, or did not come to your rescue?”</p>

<p>“She is here,” said a voice near them,—“she
is here to answer for herself.”</p>

<p>They turned quickly, and there, in her own proper
form, stood the Green Fairy, who spoke as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Green Fairy,” said she, “wished to prove
whether the child Rosebud could be as gentle, as
sweet-tempered, when in poverty, and exposed to
harsh treatment, as when living in a palace, the idol
of a court. The little fisher-boy may answer that
question for himself.”</p>

<p>But the Green Fairy was not so entirely neglectful
of the little girl. Something she could tell of a
fine-feathered bird, which guided her through the
woods. Something, too, of a bird-song, heard by a
little girl standing alone in a dark passage.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“To the left now turn the key,</div>
<div class="verse">Three times three, three times three.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Also of hopeful words, murmured softly from a
tall flowering shrub, to a child who lay one night in
the forest, looking up at the stars twinkling through
the trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Be of good cheer</div>
<div class="verse">O maiden dear;</div>
<div class="verse">No longer fear,</div>
<div class="verse">For help is near.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And something she could tell, too, of a white
lamb and of an aged woman with pale blue eyes and
dark flowing robes, who whispered to the Lily
Queen of Silver Lake, and the stream which
flowed to the sea.</p>

<p>She was at the wedding, too, looking down from
above, to see that all went well with the happy ones
below. Like this!</p>

<p>And, changing to a beautiful bird, she flew to
the top of a marble column.</p>

<p>And while they were gazing, she began to fly
slowly around the apartment, and disappeared at
last through an open window. But still they heard
her voice singing to them her last farewell:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Farewell, farewell, most noble king!</div>
<div class="indent">Farewell, farewell, O gracious queen!</div>
<div class="verse">For other lands I’m on the wing,</div>
<div class="indent">No more you’ll see the Fairy Green.</div>
<div class="verse">Long may you live, all hearts to bless,</div>
<div class="verse">Long may you know true happiness!”</div>
